  "45Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised to see your kind here. Many adventurers have traveled this way since the recent troubles began.\n\nNo doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, walks the world again.\n\nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark Wanderer did travel this route a few weeks ago. He was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the Rogue Monastery.\n\nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to have trailed in his wake. You see, shortly after the Wanderer went through, the Monastery's Gates to the pass were closed and strange creatures began ravaging the countryside.\n\nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the gates are re-opened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all.  If you're still alive then, I'll take you along.\n\nYou should talk to Akara, too. She seems to be the leader of this camp. Maybe she can tell you more.",
  "45Well met, noble Paladin. It's been a while since I've seen any of your kind in the west. It would be an honor to aid you in any way that I can.\n\nNo doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, walks the world again.\n\nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark Wanderer did travel this route a few weeks ago. He was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the Rogue Monastery.\n\nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to have trailed in his wake. You see, shortly after the Wanderer went through, the Monastery's Gates to the pass were closed and strange creatures began ravaging the countryside.\n\nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the gates are re-opened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all.  If you're still alive then, I'll take you along.\n\nYou should talk to Akara, too. She seems to be the leader of this camp. Maybe she can tell you more.",
  "51I've been leading my trade caravan across the eastern deserts for more than twenty years now. I've been attacked by bandits and outlaws more times than I can remember. But never when a Paladin accompanied me. \n\nIndeed, your Order has saved me from losing a small fortune over the years. I just hope you can discover what's going on around here and get the Gates to the East opened up!",
  "85Cain seems to have great wisdom regarding the supernatural. I hope I never live to be that wise...",
  "58Akara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She sells the few magic items in her possession and can even heal your wounds. She is very wise and will help you if she can.",
  "66The fiery Kashya commands the Rogue archers in battle. I've only spoken to her a few times, though. I get the feeling that she doesn't like outsiders very much.",
  "88Charsi seems to be a very sweet girl. She's the smith around here and can help you by trading weapons and armor.",
  "55Gheed is a wandering merchant of questionable character who is traveling along with my caravan to the East. He will buy and sell most anything.\n\nHe's greedy, but his wares are beyond reproach. I would suggest keeping both eyes open when you deal with him.",
  "71To the east are lands of great mystery... and the Jewel City of the Desert, Lut Gholein.",
  "68I'll gladly take you eastward, if you can drive the Evil from the Monastery.  Then, the Rogues may re-open the pass through the mountains.",
  "70It's easy to become lost in the wilderness on the way to the Citadel. After you have come to the Cairn Stones, you must remember that the path continues through the caves.",
  "35I am Akara, High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I welcome you, traveler, to our camp, but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor shelter within these rickety walls.\n\nYou see, our ancient Sisterhood has fallen under a strange curse. The mighty Citadel from which we have guarded the gates to the East for generations, has been corrupted by the evil Demoness, Andariel.\n\nI still can't believe it... but she turned many of our sister Rogues against us and drove us from our ancestral home. Now the last defenders of the Sisterhood are either dead or scattered throughout the wilderness.\n\nI implore you, stranger. Please help us. Find a way to lift this terrible curse and we will pledge our loyalty to you for all time.",
  "34Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good to see more of your kind at work in the world these dark days. In my opinion, the world needs more women to fight against the great shadow. But I am forgetting my manners... \n\nI am Akara, High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I welcome you, traveler, to our camp, but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor shelter within these rickety walls.\n\nYou see, our ancient Sisterhood has fallen under a strange curse. The mighty Citadel from which we have guarded the gates to the East for generations, has been corrupted by the evil Demoness, Andariel.\n\nI still can't believe it... but she turned many of our sister Rogues against us and drove us from our ancestral home. Now the last defenders of the Sisterhood are either dead or scattered throughout the wilderness.\n\nI implore you, stranger: please help us. Find a way to lift this terrible curse and we will pledge our loyalty to you for all time.",
  "42The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has a long and distinguished history. Over the generations our Order has become a deadly fighting force as well as a bastion for women who sought to forge their own destiny.\n\nYet beware, young one, the lure of power and knowledge can lead to disaster. I have seen ambition foul the bravest of hearts and recklessness dull hard-won wisdom.\n\nYou would do well to tread lightly upon the dark path you have chosen to explore.",
  "49I understand that Cain is the last descendant of the ancient Horadrim and that his knowledge of their lore is vast. He could prove to be very useful in discerning the nature of our current crisis.",
  "49Kashya has always been fiercely loyal, but I fear her anger and frustration over these recent events will lead her into harm's way. She is highly protective of the few Rogues remaining under her command and will not send them into combat unless there is dire need.",
  "46Charsi is young and innocent. However, I believe her Barbarian blood thrills to the prospect of adventure and danger. She takes great pride in her work and finds comfort in the fact that her weapons and armor are helping to end this evil plague.",
  "48Though he has only been our guest for a short time, I sense that Warriv has faced many harrowing trials. Though he knows, as I do, that a terrible evil has blanketed the land, his only real concern is to reach the eastern trading ports with his caravan.",
  "53To be honest, I have done my best to stay clear of Gheed. He wears dishonesty about himself like a cloak and seeks only to better his situation by preying on the misfortunes of others.",
  "55The wilderness is overrun with Evil and the minions of Hell have taken our rightful home. We must purge all Evil from the Monastery and restore order to the world.",
  "53I often dream of the day we reclaim our own. The Sightless Eye sees through the mist of time a great glory ahead, but how far ahead the Eye cannot discern.",
  "67Our mental discipline is matched only by our skill in archery... I only hope these are enough to withstand this awful trial.",
  "59Beware that you do not suffer the fate of the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's life is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul is even worse.",
  "41Even though the corrupted ones were once of our Order, you need not shy from slaying them, for they stand between you and Andariel.\n\nPerhaps, when the Demon Queen is dead, our Sisters will return to life, but more likely they will be forever bound to their unholy pact.",
  "56Welcome, outlander, to our glorious hovel. I know you're here to challenge the evil that's driven us from our ancestral home.\n\nBut, know this. Akara may be our spiritual leader, but I command the Rogues in battle. It will take more than just killing a few beasts in the wilderness to earn my trust.",
  "55Well, well, I never expected to see an Amazon in these lands. You're very brave to have come here. Many of my fellow Sisters have fallen under some dark spell, and if you're not careful you may fall prey to it as well.",
  "60When I was very young, Akara told me tales of the Amazons' fearlessness in battle and of their skills with spears and bows. I like to think we Rogues have much in common with you Amazons.",
  "64Some of my Rogues told me of Deckard Cain. They said that he is a man of great wisdom. Personally, I don't know how wise he could possibly be if he never learned how to wage battle himself.",
  "57Akara has been like a mother to me for as long as I can remember. She is wise and good, but I don't think she has the steel to retake our Monastery by force.",
  "89I don't trust many outlanders, but Warriv seems fine. He never says much to me, though.",
  "66Before our exile, Charsi, our blacksmith, could fashion any implement of war.\n\nHere in the camp, she merely makes do. Her best tools remain within the Monastery.",
  "58Gheed is a pig. I've been tempted to throw him out of the camp many times, but Charsi seems to think that he's good company. I don't trust the man, but if she's comforted by him, then I'll desist.",
  "76If we could only find out how Andariel has managed to corrupt our Sisters, then, perhaps, we could drive out the evil clouding their minds.",
  "68In this camp, those of us who have remained true to our Order are forced to live among common traders and farm animals.\n\nWelcome to our circle of suffering.",
  "67Perhaps Tristram deserved its fate... for letting Evil loose upon the land. I only hope we don't suffer the same.",
  "71Some evenings we gather at the bonfire to retell epic tales... and try to forget about the terrible events that led to losing the Monastery.",
  "47Hi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here in camp. It's good to see some strong adventurers around here.\n\nMany of our Sisters fought bravely against Diablo when he first attacked the town of Tristram. They came back to us true veterans, bearing some really powerful items. Seems like their victory was short-lived, though... Most of them are now corrupted by Andariel.",
  "54Wow. You're a Barbarian, huh? It's really great to meet you. I've seen a few of your kind around here lately. I'm a little jealous... I wish I could go off adventuring with you.\n\nOh, by the way... I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here in camp.",
  "57You know, I've been with the Sisters for as long as I can remember. But Akara told me that my real parents were Barbarians from the northern tribes and that they were killed when I was very young.\n\nSometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I had been raised as a Barbarian.\n\nI don't know. I love being a blacksmith... but sometimes I just want to get out and explore the world, you know?",
  "86I don't really know anything about Cain. He seems to have a lot of secrets... That makes me nervous.",
  "51Oh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a little hard on outsiders, but who can blame her? All she wants is to protect our Order. But now that our Sisters have turned against us... I think this whole mess has hardened her heart.",
  "64Akara, our priestess and seer, is most upset by the corruption of our Sisters. I fear that she blames herself.",
  "80Warriv's all right, I guess. He seems too serious most of the time. I haven't really talked to him all that much.",
  "60Oh, I like Gheed. He's very funny. He has all sorts of interesting stories from the places he's been. I wish I could see the sights he has.",
  "84I don't know why some of my Sisters chose to follow Andariel. Those who strayed were among our finest warriors.",
  "48Good day to you partner! I'm Gheed and I can already tell that I'll be your best friend in this forsaken camp.\n\nA spare weapon, some gold, a small gem is all I want in exchange for the equipment you'll need on whatever quests you might undertake.\n\nNow, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my items are guaranteed for life and come with a two-day warranty!",
  "46A Necromancer! I hoped I'd never have to lay my eyes on one of your kind again. ... The recent troubles in this area have brought out all kinds, I see. Nevertheless, your money's good...\n\nA spare weapon, some gold, a small gem is all I want in exchange for the equipment you'll need on whatever quests you might undertake!\n\nNow, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my items are guaranteed for life and come with a two-day warranty!",
  "74Don't think you can fool me, Necromancer. I've seen what your kind can do. If you're involved in any of the evil out there, I don't even want to know. Trade quickly and be about your business!",
  "57That old coot, Cain, is as crazy as a wet Quill Rat. I hear he survived whatever happened in Tristram. Personally, I wouldn't trust a thing he has to say.",
  "55Akara and Kashya are Sisters in the Order of the Sightless Eye, but they are worlds apart. Akara is a slow river of magic, and Kashya, a viper of war. They're both deeply devoted to their religious order, yet the corruption of their Sisters pains them both to no end.",
  "52Charsi is a fine girl..., but she has no business savvy! I know she means well, but the prices she charges for weapons and armor will never earn her a profit.\n\nAs long as I keep filling her mind with stories of adventure, she'll never catch on to the fact that I'm raking in gold hand over fist!",
  "55Warriv was kind enough to let me travel with his caravan, but don't let him drag you into a search for a new Eastern trade route.\n\nI'm making a fortune right here... from the Rogues, of course! You, on the other hand, always get my best prices!",
  "61Andariel's demonic forces have taken up residence in the forests as well as the Monastery. Uh-uh. I won't be venturing out of the camp. So, if you need anything, I'll be right here.",
  "58When - or if - I get to Lut Gholein, I'm going to find the largest bowl of Narlant weed and smoke 'til all earthly sense has left my body.",
  "43Long ago, the Soulstones were given to the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. They were used to bind the three Prime Evils. I now know that even these holy artifacts were no match for Diablo's power.\n\nI hope that his two brothers are more securely held... but I fear the worst.",
  "54It takes time to master your skills... and use will hone your technique. But take care to choose your new skills wisely.",
  "52You may recover some mysterious things from the demons you kill. Some of great use to you... some of great peril! Bring them to me and I'll reveal their secrets.",
  "46Have I told you about the Horadrim? They were an ancient confederation of mage-clans who sought to bind the three Prime Evils for eternity. The Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... and it appears that the bonds they wove are unravelling!\n\nAs the last of the Horadrim, I pray that I can help you remedy their failure.",
  "43Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were cast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It seems that Hell's balance has shifted, as Andariel is now aligned with the Lord of Terror. Her presence here in the mortal realm does not bode well for us.",
  "90Turn back! I can tell that you need more experience to fight safely in the next wilderness.",
  "46Halt! You should complete Akara's quest before venturing further. Search for the Den in the wilderness closer to camp.",
  "116Beware! The evil is strong ahead.",
  "92Beware! Beyond lies mortal danger for the likes of you!",
  "88Take care! The Corrupted Rogues in the wilderness ahead are not to be trifled with.",
  "43There is a place of great evil in the wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures and horrors from beyond the grave.\n\nI fear that these creatures are massing for an attack against our encampment. If you are sincere about helping us, find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts.\n\nMay the Great Eye watch over you.",
  "46I should add that many Rogue scouts have died in that horrible place. We cannot afford to lose any more. If you choose to enter that Den of Evil, you must do so alone.",
  "87The demons in that cave have claimed many of my finest archers. I wonder how you will fare!",
  "95The beasts from the cave have begun to roam throughout the countryside. You'd better be careful out there.",
  "95You seem like a noble warrior. I hope you can help us.",
  "67You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust my sacred scepter into the foulest, carbuncular trull than set one boot into that cave.",
  "122One who seeks that cave, seeks death.",
  "85Your task is not complete until you have killed all the demons in that cave.",
  "111You'd better come through on this. Your reputation depends on it.",
  "148You haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do you need anything?",
  "73Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I think you might need a new weapon.",
  "124One who hesitates... does so with good reason.",
  "65You have cleansed the Den of Evil. You've earned my trust and may yet restore my faith in humanity.\n\nYour reward is training in the skill of your choice.",
  "74Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may reward you.",
  "94You are truly brave and skillful...  Akara was worried about you.",
  "87The only good demon is a dead one, I say.\n\nBy the way, did you happen to find anything in that cave you'd like to sell?",
  "120...That which does not kill you makes you stronger.",
  "56My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the Monastery graveyard!\n\nApparently, Andariel is not content to take only our living. Blood Raven, one of our finest captains in the battle against Diablo at Tristram, was also one of the first to be corrupted by Andariel.\n\nNow, you'll find her in the Monastery graveyard raising our dead as zombies!\n\nWe cannot abide this defilement! If you are truly our ally, you will help us destroy her.",
  "80Death has done nothing to weaken Blood Raven's combat skills. If anything, she's more deadly than ever.",
  "99Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue band that once fought Diablo at Tristram.",
  "94I'm sorry... The undead are bad for trade. I have a strict no-return policy.",
  "51Blood Raven fought valiantly against Diablo in the catacombs beneath Tristram... She was never quite the same afterwards. It is now obvious she brought an evil influence back with her.",
  "140Hmmm...\n\nHow can one kill what is already dead?",
  "99Each moment you delay adds another undead Sister to Blood Raven's army.",
  "70If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear that our Order will perish forever.",
  "68Akara felt something was wrong even before Andariel descended upon us. She feared that Blood Raven had stumbled upon some evil force beneath Tristram.\n\nI wish we had acted then...",
  "77I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on everybody.",
  "86When the dead return to prey upon the living, it is a terror beyond understanding.",
  "55I can hardly believe that you've defeated Blood Raven!\n\nThough she was once my closest friend, I pray that her tortured spirit remains banished forever.\n\nYou have earned my respect, stranger... and the allegiance of the Rogues. I have placed several of my best warriors at your disposal.",
  "122Andariel must be made to pay for her sacrilege!",
  "77Kashya wishes to reward you for your defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, too, even though Blood Raven was once my friend.",
  "148Some of those gals weren't so nice the first time around.",
  "104You've done well, stranger. I hope all your efforts are worth it.",
  "50It is clear that we are facing an Evil difficult to comprehend, let alone combat.\n\nThere is only one Horadrim sage, schooled in the most arcane history and lore, who could advise us... His name is Deckard Cain.\n\nYou must go to Tristram and find him, my friend. I pray that he still lives.",
  "90The bark of Inifuss holds mystical runes.\n\nAkara can translate them... into our revenge!",
  "42Tristram is too far to journey by foot...  Cain would likely be dead, when you arrived. However, there is a magical portal that will take you there instantly.\n\nTo open it, one must stand within the circle of Cairn Stones and touch them in a certain order. The proper order can be found in the runes written on the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.\n\nYou must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss and bring back its bark. I will translate the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic pattern.",
  "117If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, Akara will tell you how to get to Tristram.",
  "68Months ago, I came across a few survivors from Tristram. They said that Cain had gone half-mad and could no longer distinguish fact from fantasy.",
  "98I would sooner micturate in a tankard of my own ale than journey to Tristram!",
  "150Without the bark of Inifuss you can't find Cain.",
  "76How will you find Cain without going to Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is the first step on your journey.",
  "96The Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but you'll know it when you see it.",
  "99Barking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll find it, just keep looking.",
  "70He who seeks that which cannot be found must look inside himself for further guidance... or look harder!",
  "82With this scroll you may open a portal back to Tristram. Only Akara can decipher its logic.",
  "168Get this to Akara.\n\nOnly she can understand it.",
  "72Look, friend... I trade a lot of strange items, but I'm not going to start dealing in bark. Okay?",
  "86This looks like gibberish to me. Akara may know what to make of it.",
  "64Ah, very good. I have translated the runes on this scroll. You must find the Cairn Stones and touch them in the order that I have written.",
  "103Deckard Cain has crucial knowledge about the Evils we face. You must find him!",
  "92I have heard that Tristram is now in ruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin of all of us.",
  "68I'm told that Tristram now resembles a mead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! I will wait here for your most glorious return.",
  "82It is too dangerous to travel to Tristram. I won't be leaving here until the way is clear!",
  "64If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram before all is lost!",
  "82You have risked your life to rescue Cain. For that we thank you.\n\nWe must seek his counsel immediately.",
  "78Again, you amaze me, outlander.\n\nThe Sisterhood is grateful to you for delivering Cain to us. I believe Akara has something to tell you.",
  "53Ah, Cain is here... another customer. I haven't been this pleased since a love-starved maiden let down a bit more than her hair.",
  "102Akara wishes to reward you for your bravery in returning Deckard Cain.",
  "80Only a brave adventurer could return with Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward for your valor.",
  "74As a token of my gratitude, I will identify items for you at no charge.",
  "82...I thank you, friend, for coming to my aid.",
  "75Oh... Blessings on the Rogues! They finally rescued me from that cursed place!",
  "33Regrettably, I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world!\n\nAs you know, some time ago Diablo was slain beneath Tristram.  And when our hero emerged triumphant from the labyrinth beneath town, we held a grand celebration that lasted several days.\n\nYet, as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof. He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and seemed to lapse into a dark, brooding depression. I thought that perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out of his mind.\n\nThe hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night -- always something about 'the East'.\n\nOne day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.\n\nI believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.\n\nI fear even worse, my friend... I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If true, Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.\n\nYou must stop him or all will be lost.",
  "36...And so it came to pass that the Countess, who once bathed in the rejuvenating blood of a hundred virgins, was buried alive... And her castle in which so many cruel deeds took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising over the buried dungeons in that god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary tower, like some monument to Evil, is all that remains.\n\nThe Countess' fortune was believed to be divided among the clergy, although some say that more remains unfound, still buried alongside the rotting skulls that bear mute witness to the inhumanity of the human creature.",
  "110The only wealth you're likely to find there is a wealth of vermin.",
  "70That old tower is as rotten on the inside as it appears on the outside. I heard that several Sisters came to a gruesome end when a stairwell collapsed on them.",
  "67The dangers there are not solely architectural. Once inside that wretched place, many succumb to a vile miasma.",
  "60That tower marks a place of danger. There is an epic poem about it...  How much sorrow one can stand was tested there.",
  "81Rumors of treasure are no different from rumors of any other kind. They hold false promise to those who should know better.",
  "78The tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we have found are death, delirium, and disappointment.",
  "151Have you suddenly lost your taste for wealth?",
  "94Quickly in and quickly out is all the advice I can give you.",
  "118Better an empty pocket than a full grave.",
  "170You're not ready to give up, are you?",
  "140There is no more I can tell you about that ancient tower.",
  "79Guess what! I've named a boil on my ass after you. It, too, bothers me every time I sit down.",
  "79Your rewards are well-earned. To us, the tower was nothing more than a headstone looming over a long forgotten grave.",
  "62Remember. Wealth is as insubstantial as a cloud and passes as quickly. Ignore Gheed. All that twitters is not bold.",
  "68Warriv's advice is like corpse gas; it befouls the air for a moment and then it disappears.",
  "58I thought the stories of treasure in the tower were nothing but lies. I am glad you found something of value in that death-trap. Would that our Sisters had been so fortunate.",
  "126Those riches will serve you well on the long road ahead.",
  "69Well done, my friend. Courage and opportunity together have created in you a kind of alchemy.",
  "66When I fled the Monastery, I left behind the Horadric Malus, my enchanted smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen your equipment.",
  "51The Malus was forged and enchanted by the ancient Horadric Mages during the Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, the Malus was entrusted to the Sisterhood guarding the pass into the East.",
  "59The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is not without risk. Our Monastery is filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd best be careful, my friend.",
  "61Charsi is wasting her time and talents using an inferior hammer! Had she the Horadric Malus, she could make the steel sing and craft you a suit of armor as impenetrable as the Great Eye.",
  "87The Monastery can confuse even those who know it well. Stay alert in there.",
  "74Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but this Horadric Malus. Between you and her my ears need a rest.\n\nJust find it and bring it back quickly.",
  "74I have offered my nomadic phallus, but to no avail.",
  "68Just as an archer needs bow and arrow, or a draughtsman pen and paper, so Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with which to ply her trade.",
  "57The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, search thoroughly in the Barracks... That is where the Rogues kept their forge.",
  "98If you can't carry out this quest, how will you face the greater evils ahead?",
  "71To do battle with Andariel requires more than thick skin and a strong will. You'll want armor and weaponry forged with the hammer's enchantments.",
  "89The Malus is a Horadric artifact of great power. Please bring it back.",
  "90I have heard that you bear us no Malus.",
  "120What better opportunity to show your mettle?",
  "59The magical effects imbued by the Malus are impossible to predict, but are always to the good.",
  "57Well done, my friend. But remember, the return of the Horadric Malus is but one step in reclaiming the Monastery.",
  "74Now that the Horadric Malus is back in our possession, we shall use it to deliver a great blow against the Evil which torments this land.",
  "72Oh! Thanks so much for returning the Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of your items with magical powers.",
  "120I guess it's too late to take back some of the names I called you.",
  "118I am glad the hammer has returned and you with it.",
  "34It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their ancestral Monastery. This does not bode well for us, my friend.\n\nAncient Horadric texts record that Andariel and the other Lesser Evils once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing them from Hell to our world. Here, they caused mankind untold anguish and suffering before they were finally bound within the Soulstones.\n\nAndariel's presence here could mean that the forces of Hell are once again aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. If this is true, then I fear for us all.\n\nYou must kill her before the Monastery becomes a permanent outpost of Hell and the way east lost forever.",
  "45Diablo is heading east for some foul purpose. And the only passage east is through the Monastery gate. Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel to block any pursuit.\n\nFor her part Andariel hopes to win Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are always vying for positions of power within the unholy hierarchy!",
  "63Andariel has desecrated all we hold dear. She must not be permitted to serve Diablo.\n\nDestroy her! Her corruption of our Order must be undone!",
  "132Send Andariel back to the Hell she came from!",
  "71You're going after Andariel?\n\n... One of my wagon wheels is in need of repair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm needed.",
  "72The mapmakers tell us the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\n\nOur way east is a line that runs through Andariel's stronghold, the Monastery.",
  "81I can imagine a thousand different ways to kill Andariel. You need only choose one.",
  "48It is clear that Andariel is acting on behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone from following him eastward. Her defeat would allow you to continue the pursuit.\n\nAncient lore has it that while Andariel was spawned in the Burning Hells, she is not fond of fire.",
  "57You have done much to help us, but I sense that this has only fueled Andariel's fury. She will not stop until we are all dead.\n\nYou must kill Andariel before her army can gain the upper hand.",
  "72Have you stumbled upon that Demon Queen, yet? I hear she's quite the beauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish go, that is.",
  "108If you are the hero that you seem to be, now is the time to prove it.",
  "90May I remind you that my caravan can only go east, if the Monastery is cleansed?",
  "126Deckard Cain has important information about Andariel.",
  "64Finally, we may rejoice!\n\nWe owe you a debt we can never repay. I only hope that in time we will be able to rebuild our Order.\n\nAll our thanks go with you, my friend.",
  "86You'll probably go east now... It was good to know you. I hope you'll come back if you ever need anything.",
  "44Andariel's death brings about renewed life for us all. We mourn the loss of our dear Sisters, but at least now we can get on with our lives.\n\nI... may have misjudged you, outlander. You are a true hero and testament to the noble spirit which has inspired our Order for generations.\n\nFare well... my friend.",
  "100I'm going to party like it's 999!",
  "82The caravan is prepared. We may now journey eastward to Lut Gholein.",
  "38This is a great victory indeed, but many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey, lending what assistance I can... \n\nRemember... Diablo is still out there, seeking something in the desert. I'm afraid that this nightmare will not end until you find what it is that he seeks.",
  "600Halt.",
  "290You may not pass.",
  "255Welcome to the palace.",
  "255You may enter the palace.",
  "290Stay out of trouble.",
  "58I'll bet you wonder how this town manages to stay safe with all the trouble going on out in the desert. Well, I can tell you that it's got nothing to do with the local town guards... they're all in the palace for some reason.\n\nJerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to help keep the peace around here. We're not cheap, but we're the best this wasteland has to offer.",
  "85We do a good job in town, but beyond the city gates, you'll find all manner of demons.",
  "52The local guards were all relocated to the palace after the troubles began. No one really knows why. Actually, all of the town's brothel girls have been hiding out in the palace's cellar lately, so I assume that the guards have been assigned to 'protect them' with their lives.",
  "75I might spare you a few of my men. Why, enough gold can muster an army.",
  "61Jerhyn's got a nice little trading post going here. Despite his youth, he is a clever businessman. As you can see by that palace, he's done quite well for himself.",
  "99We're keeping the town safe and tight, but I've got a hunch there's something Jerhyn's not telling us.",
  "44Ah, Elzix is quite a character. I had a few run-ins with his band of outlaws in my younger years. Now, he's as settled as the dunes out there. The Desert Rain Inn is his pride and joy these days.",
  "53Atma seems to be a fine woman. But I'm sure the loss of her family has made her lonely. Perhaps I should go over and console her when I get off duty tonight...",
  "72Geglash is an imposing warrior, but he's never been able to back down from a fight. One of these days, his pride will be the death of him.",
  "67Meshif has sailed all around the southern seas and visited many strange lands. It must be driving him mad, having to stay anchored here.",
  "70I haven't talked much to Fara. She keeps to herself most of the time. I get the feeling that she doesn't like us mercenary types much.",
  "73I'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you. He's always mixing his damned potions and chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised if he winds up blowing himself to smithereens!",
  "85Drognan's a mystery to me. Then again, I never did trust mages much.",
  "61Hmm... You look like a sturdy adventurer.\n\nYou know, I used to be quite the scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest group of bandits who ever terrorized these sands!\n\nNowadays, I run this here Inn and pretty much stay out of trouble.\n\nMy days of adventuring are behind me.",
  "48Ah... You must be one of the new heroes who've come to rid our city of evil. Under any other circumstances, I'd be surprised to see one of your kind in the city. But lately... Oh, never mind all that...\n\nYou know, I used to be quite the scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest group of bandits who ever terrorized these sands!\n\nNowadays, I run this here Inn and pretty much stay out of trouble.\n\nMy days of adventuring are behind me.",
  "52You know, I've lost a number of body parts over the years. An eye here, a leg there...\n\nSay, do you know any spells that'd grow them back for me? Hmm... On second thought, I'll leave well enough alone.",
  "90What tales Drognan can tell... You would do well to listen carefully to that wizened wizard.",
  "80There are many ancient tombs in the desert. Most of them are already plundered, but I imagine that some have remained hidden.",
  "67I miss the brothels that used to do business here.\n\nYou know, all of the ladies fled to the palace as soon as the trouble in the desert started. You'd think that they could at least come out once in a while now that Greiz and his men have things relatively under control.",
  "71Atma... Now, there's a fine woman. Lately, though, she's only thinking about revenge. She has reason enough...",
  "71We've all fared well under Jerhyn's leadership. The town has remained safe throughout this whole mess; and yet the lad still seems very upset about something.",
  "88Geglash is a fool who would fight his own shadow if he could. Fighting's all he ever thinks about!",
  "74Meshif is a wise Captain, I think. Wise enough to know silver from tin and truth from dung, that's for sure.",
  "65Fara is a good woman. She seems very sad, but seldom speaks of her past. She's good to the poor and helps people when she can. That makes her all right in my book.",
  "70That Lysander's a grumpy old cuss. You'd better not disturb him while he's working on his potions, or... BOOM! You could get blasted to the moon.",
  "62Now that Andariel is dead, I can return and outfit the Rogues properly. Once I've made some trades here, I'll be free to head back to their Monastery. Let me know if you want to travel along.",
  "106Caravans take people where they want to go - until they get there.",
  "80By ship is the only way eastward from here. I believe Captain Meshif has a small trading vessel moored at the docks.",
  "70There used to be a lot of brothels here... I guess the troubles scared all the women away, or maybe they're 'safe' in Jerhyn's palace.",
  "53That old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty as they come. Years back, he made off with a small fortune of my caravan's wares. I certainly never expected to see him so... domesticated.",
  "57Jerhyn has his father's strength and wits. He's young, but he rules this place with wisdom and care. I think he'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided we all survive this crisis.",
  "59You'll forgive me if I seem upset. I've suffered a loss recently, but that's not your problem.\n\nIt's a relief to see some proper warriors come through here. My name is Atma. I run the tavern here in Lut Gholein.",
  "86Evil has laid siege to Lut Gholein and you may be our last hope...",
  "56This public house used to be quite lively, until this plague of evil. Luckily, I've managed to save away a tidy nest egg. Unfortunately, I couldn't save everything I cared for...",
  "57In addition to my public house, there used to be several brothels doing business here. When the troubles first started in the desert, the harem guilds sought sanctuary within the palace.\n\nOf course, Jerhyn was glad to oblige. I'll bet they're finding many ways to repay him for his protection.",
  "70Geglash may seem like a sot, but he's a brave man. All this trouble has driven him to drinking more than his usual.",
  "64Elzix and I have reached an understanding over the years. He sends travelers to me for drink and entertainment, and I send them back to him for a soft bed. The travelers often trade their wares for lodging.",
  "89Meshif seldom patronizes my establishment. I think he prefers to stay out there on his leaky ship.",
  "71Oh, Lysander is cranky, but he's a good old man. He used to give me medicines when... my son was ill.",
  "78Drognan is a very private person. He's always studying ancient scrolls and such. He may be a mystery to me forever.",
  "57Bah! I don't know why you people keep pestering me.\n\nGreiz seems to have this place locked down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't have done the same! I've proven my valor in combat plenty of times.",
  "43Hey, you're a Barbarian, aren't ya? Ferocious as the wild beasts of the north, that's what they say. I suppose you've come to help save this city. You needn't bother.\n\nGreiz seems to have this place locked down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't have done the same! I've proven my valor in combat plenty of times.",
  "46Hey, I heard that you Barbarians can wield multiple weapons at once. I never learned to fight two-handed. Carrying a sword and a wineskin at the same time is all I can ever handle.",
  "53Sure, I hear lots of what goes on. Did you hear about the harem guilds? They were the only ones allowed to hide out in the palace when the raids started!\n\nAh... It figures.",
  "64I've killed plenty of those demons out in the desert. It doesn't seem to slow them down any, though... they just keep coming back for more.",
  "55Have you found those big sand maggots yet? Arrows and all that don't work so well against them. Best thing is to hack 'em with a sword or such.",
  "58There are some ancient tombs out there in the desert. You have to go pretty far to find them, though. Rumor has it that they're crawling with walking corpses now.\n\nTsh. As if the Saber Cats and Claw Vipers weren't bad enough.",
  "67Yeah. Meshif's okay, I guess. But I'll be damned if I ever get on his ship. I don't even like to drink water.",
  "52Jerhyn's been acting strange lately. I can't imagine why he recalled the town guards into the palace. If there is something wrong in there, I hope he doesn't expect me to handle it.",
  "57I've seen Fara defend herself against a few drunken ruffians. She's got moves I've never even seen before. Wherever she's from, she sure learned how to fight there.",
  "83I've got no time for old alchemists. Lysander would be completely useless in a real fight.",
  "63Greetings. I'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I make port runs around the Twin Seas and occasionally out to Kingsport in Westmarch.\n\nI haven't sailed anywhere lately, though... Jerhyn has ordered me to stay docked here in case of emergency.",
  "54Greetings, Amazon. I haven't seen one of your kind in many years.... It's good to know that warriors of your caliber are protecting this city.\n\nI'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I make port runs around the Twin Seas and occasionally out to Kingsport in Westmarch.\n\nI haven't sailed anywhere lately, though... Jerhyn has ordered me to stay docked here in case of emergency.",
  "62I was wondering if you've heard any news from Kurast? I know you Amazons travel extensively. Have you been there recently?\n\nHmm... Well, I hope the port opens soon. I need to get home to Kurast and find out what's been happening there.",
  "72There's something Jerhyn's not telling me, I just don't know what. To my eye, things here in town don't look that bad, especially since Warriv's caravan route opened up.",
  "65I've been all around the seas in these parts. It's dangerous sailing west this time of year, though. Until the season changes, the caravan through the desert is the main trade route to Westmarch.",
  "75My ship is the only way East from here. Still, Lord Jerhyn tells me that I may not leave until the current crisis is over.",
  "65Oh, I've known Elzix for years. He always offers me a free room at his Inn when I dock here, but I prefer the comforts of my own cabin.",
  "61Warriv is a good friend. We've shared many tales, he and I. If we had it all to do over again, I believe we'd both be explorers of some renown.",
  "69Greiz seems to be a dependable fellow. I hope he can handle it if those things in the desert decide to attack this town.",
  "130Atma serves a fine ale in her establishment.",
  "70Hah! That braggart Geglash says he fears neither man nor beast. Yet, when I offer to take him out to sea, he quakes with fear.",
  "130The lady Fara has a proud, noble air about her.",
  "41Greetings, honored traveler. I am Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm glad to know that once again caravans are free to travel through the Western Pass.\n\nFor some time now, we have been under siege by an evil power that I cannot identify. Strange... It all began when a Dark Wanderer came this way, looking for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain to be far out in the desert.\n\nNow, my people whisper tales of the dead rising from their tombs and horrible creatures lurking amongst the moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed things which I cannot explain. I've ordered the port closed and all trade ships moored until I am sure that my city is safe.\n\nAtma, the tavernkeeper, has an important mission for you. Go see her immediately. You'll find her on the other side of town.\n\nNow, I must return to the palace. I apologize, but I can't invite you in. Things are... rather a mess right now.",
  "51For trade in magic and the like, see Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the wisest man I know - without equal in magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion chemist.\n\nFor travel back west, see Warriv, whom you already know.\n\nOur own Fara is a fine and honest armorer, and she can heal wounds as well.\n\nElzix is the Innkeeper and may also have some items to trade.\n\nGreiz, the mercenary captain I hired to secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps order in town, as well.\n\nThere are others here, too. I'm sure you'll meet most of them. Just look around...",
  "117Things are getting worse by the hour. I know everything looks fine, but trust me, it isn't!",
  "117Things are getting worse by the hour. I know everything looks fine, but trust me, it isn't!",
  "63To any who aid me in the defense of Lut Gholein, I pledge my support. Passage East, wealth, honor - all are due to those who help my city.",
  "71You seem very capable, but no offense is intended when I say that I must choose my confidants carefully. It wouldn't do to have rumors sending everyone into a panic.",
  "87Even though he was once a bandit, I permitted Elzix to take over the Desert Rain Inn. He has been quite civilized ever since.",
  "76When you arrived, Warriv's caravan had been long overdue. With all of the evil that's arisen in the land, I'm surprised he got through at all.",
  "77Meshif is an honorable man, but I fear that he is growing impatient with me about impounding his ship. I dare not tell him what's really happening in this city.",
  "98The woman, Atma, may have some useful gossip for you. She can always be found near her public house.",
  "81I know much about the ancient religions. I was trained as a Paladin of Zakarum in the Eastern Kurast temple many years ago.",
  "103Welcome, brother Paladin.\n\nI am Fara. I was once a devout champion of Zakarum.",
  "67Perhaps, in time, you will play a part in reclaiming our Order's honor and spirit. You are an inspiration to me, brother Paladin.",
  "60The shrines in the desert are leftover artifacts from the great Sin War that ravaged these lands almost a thousand years ago. They still function, but most travelers believe them only to be remnants of the distant past.",
  "54I've no love for brothels, as they can lead honorable men to do dishonorable things. Since the local harems took up hiding in the palace, however, there seems to be a rise in foul tempers.",
  "66When the Three Evils were bound ages ago, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, was moved to Kurast and bound by the holiest of magics.",
  "79Warriv may not remember me, but I helped him out when I was a young Paladin. There's no need for me to remind him. The rewards for honor will not come in this life.",
  "68Greiz is a fine warrior and leader, but in his heart, he will always be a mercenary for hire. I cannot be loyal to those who have no loyalty to themselves.",
  "90Atma is a good, loving woman. But I fear she will succumb to her despair and hatred.",
  "95Geglash is too confident in his abilities. A warrior's true strength is in his heart.",
  "94Meshif is an honest man as far as I can tell. He has never pestered me about my past.",
  "61How do I know I can trust you? Hmm?\n\nYou may be as shifty as that pack rat, Elzix, who runs the Inn. But, if you need a potion, though, I suppose I can make you one... for a price, of course.",
  "109Potions are delicate mixtures. They're just as liable to go off in your face as anything.",
  "65Ah... The sweetest desert flower - that's Atma. Even my strongest brew can't bring back her family, though.",
  "86There are some ancient enchanted fountains in the desert that can heal your wounds - if you drink enough from them.",
  "71Oh. Deafness has its advantages, you know. I'm no longer forced to overhear the tedious gossip of others.",
  "54I never patronized the brothels, mind you. But since those ladies took up hiding in the palace, there certainly has been less scenery to feast my eyes on.",
  "95Oh... I have great faith in Greiz. He seems to have things well in hand.",
  "90I've traded my potions to Warriv many times. Yes. They seem to fetch a good price in the western lands.",
  "71I've sold many sea-sickness potions to Meshif over the years. It seems that many of his passengers don't take well to the rocking of his ship on the open seas.",
  "58Oh... Young Jerhyn used to purchase minor love potions from me, hoping to win the favors of the harem girls.\n\nBut now that the girls have taken up residence in the palace, he doesn't come around here anymore. Well, well... I've always said, 'alchemy is no substitute for experience'.",
  "57Drognan? Oh.. He's a good friend of mine. I help him find exotic spell components and alchemical books from time to time. I think he used to be a sorcerer of great renown, but he doesn't like to talk about his past.",
  "61I've heard that you are responsible for banishing Andariel back to the Burning Hells. I'm impressed, stranger. That couldn't have been easy.\n\nMy name is Drognan and I know what you're up against, my friend.\n\nYou ought to look over my inventory of items for trade.",
  "50Welcome, young Sorceress, to Lut Gholein. I hope your skills are a match for the horrors that lie beyond the city's walls. A mage of your limited experience may find the evil too great to withstand alone.\n\nMy name is Drognan and I know what you're up against, my friend.\n\nYou ought to look over my inventory of items for trade.",
  "74Many of the Mage Clans feel that women shouldn't practice magic openly. But since you've made it this far, I must say that you have proven your right to do so.",
  "57The Horadrim were a powerful Order, although maybe too prideful. Tal Rasha was one of their Order. And that should tell you something.\n\nAny man who believes himself strong enough to contain one of the Prime Evils is in for a rude awakening, I should think.",
  "78I have heard of your friend, Cain. He is the last of the Horadrim. You would do well to heed whatever advice he has to give you.",
  "53Not long ago, one of my Vizjerei comrades, who I believed had died in Tristram, came to this city. He seemed quite insane, so I dismissed much of what he said.\n\nHowever, he was able to talk his way into Jerhyn's palace. No one has seen him since. I fear that fool may have found something in the palace that led to his doom.",
  "68I've been practicing magic for more years than you could know. I'm older than I look, though not so old that I can't conjure up a few sparks.",
  "67Elzix is a sly one, I'll give him that. Of course, he never tries to cheat me. He knows what my magic skills can do.",
  "86Demons have spread throughout the desert wasteland and threaten to engulf our quiet port-city.",
  "88Meshif and his vessel should remain here, lest we risk taking demonic stowaways to other lands.",
  "58When the recent troubles began, Lord Jerhyn came seeking my council. I advised him to close the port and put the town under strict watch.\n\nLately, though, he's been occupied within the palace. I doubt his whores could divert him from his civic duties for this long, though.",
  "68Lysander is harmless enough. We keep each other company with our mutual interests, yet I don't think he could handle the enormity of our present situation.",
  "48Greetings, my friend. Have you spoken to Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable leader for being such a young man. Then again, the old blood has always run strong in this land.",
  "71There is something about Fara that troubles me. Her manner is strange for a lonely desert-maid.",
  "70Elzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him all the same.",
  "59I talked at length with Warriv as we crossed the desert from Khanduras. He has many fascinating tales of the dangers in the desert. His experience may be useful to you.",
  "57Meshif is an interesting man. Part of him longs for the freedom of the open seas... Yet his heart belongs in his homeland.",
  "42I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. But I did expect you earlier.\n\nI am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here to prevent Diablo from freeing his brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, Terror and Destruction roam free throughout your world.\n\nEven now, they head towards the Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very heart of the Zakarum Temple. There they hope to find their eldest brother, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was imprisoned there ages ago.\n\nIf the three Prime Evils unite, they will be invincible. Though it is unclear as to what their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all costs.\n\nI am broken and the energies that tie me to this world are diminishing rapidly.\n\nYou must take up this quest and prevent the Three Brothers from reuniting. You must cross the sea and search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.\n\nNow hurry, mortal... Time is running out for all of us!",
  "50Hey, hero! You're asking for trouble, if you leave town now.",
  "50I don't expect this of you, but if you want to help me, I would be grateful.\n\nIn the sewers below our city, there lurks a horrid creature that hungers for human flesh. The creature has killed many, including my son and my husband.\n\nIf you destroy it, I will reward you. Please be careful though, that beast has taken enough from us already.\n\nThe sewer entrance is through the trap door just up the street.",
  "52I've personally found some of that devil's victims washed up out of the sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or a head, and their bodies have always been skinned.\n\nAt first the creature raided the town at night... That's how Atma lost her family. Now we've got him barricaded in the sewers.\n\nYou're safe up here on the surface, but every now and again some fool wants to be a hero and heads down to the waste tunnels with a pig-sticker.",
  "68I hear that the creature kills his victims in order to hack off their limbs! I guess that makes me a less likely candidate, eh?",
  "84I've heard tales of walking corpses out in the desert at night, though I've never actually seen one.",
  "77Hey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a hole into your skull with my thumb.",
  "54I believe that the creature you refer to is one of the ancient Horadric mummies from the tombs that lie buried beneath the desert sands. It is unusual for one of his kind to be so far away from his resting place. I sense in this entity a restless and malevolent spirit.",
  "62The creature makes its lair in the tunnels beneath this city. He butchered my husband and son... I simply cannot bear to talk about it...",
  "63There are two entrances to the sewers, I believe. One of them is right near here, down by the water beneath the docks. I can see it from my ship, and you can bet I keep an eye on it every night.",
  "53Fara and I have been talking about the creature recently. From my studies, I have deduced that it is Radament the Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy that has for some reason left his tomb to prey on mortals.\n\nI'm doing some more research now. If you check back later, I may have some more insight as to his nature.",
  "94I hear that beast is after body parts. Does he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!",
  "48The Horadrim used to mummify their highest mages, and infuse them with spells that would allow them to protect their tombs, even after death.\n\nI have no idea why one of them would be acting so malevolently. Perhaps Drognan or Fara would know more about this.",
  "90Death is not afraid of the living, but the living abhor death.",
  "55I noticed a rotting, human arm floating in the harbor this morning. I suspected foul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't seem too concerned since there haven't been any folk reported missing lately.",
  "83I am starting to have second thoughts about my request... I couldn't bear the thought of you losing your life on my behalf.\n\nPlease be careful.",
  "69We've been meaning to send an organized group down there to kill that thing, but it would be dangerous. We just can't afford the chance of losing any men with all the trouble that's going on in the desert.",
  "65Ah-hah! Back for a small shot of courage... Believe me, it doesn't help for long.\n\nDrinks, barkeep!",
  "69If you're going to fight that thing, use some common sense. Be knowledgeable about what harms the undead. Poison, for instance, will have little effect.",
  "64Huh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, yes. Ooh, a foul creature...\n\nSome of my exploding potions should do quite nicely against him. They usually work well against the undead.",
  "49I've just been reading something interesting about this sort of undead. Apparently, certain Horadric funereal priests altered the bodies of their dead mages with magical and surgical techniques -- often replacing body parts with those of animals.\n\nThis was thought to augment their powers, and raise their status in the afterlife.",
  "68Drognan told me something interesting earlier today. It might explain why Radament is so restless, and it might have something to do with why he is stealing human body parts.",
  "41The Horadric mummies were created to protect the tombs, but Radament is far from his burial chamber. Given the aberrations that have been witnessed lately, it comes as no surprise that even the ancient guardian spells have begun to unravel. Be wary of this as you venture farther into the desert.",
  "76You've killed Radament, eh? That's quite a nice piece of work! If you ever need a job as a mercenary, I'd be happy to sign ya' up.",
  "52From what you tell me, it would seem that Radament was bent on the task of reviving his own mummified corpse with the flesh of the living.\n\nThis is very unusual indeed. It takes an incredible magic power to alter the singular purpose of an undead mind.\n\nPerhaps there is a power at work here which is beyond my ken.",
  "61Uh... Little of what I am able to hear is of any value. Radament's death, however, is news worth hearing. I'm sure Atma will be glad to hear of this.",
  "62Good job mate! At night out on my ship, I was often awakened by that fiend's awful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.",
  "41Whoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?\n\nI've fallen off many a barstool and no one calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They might go so far as to say, 'Geglash, you've fallen!'",
  "70We ran into one of those old tomb guardians when I ran with my bandits. I know they aren't easy foes to face, so you sure have my respect. Have you told Atma yet?",
  "142Atma's been telling everyone what you've done for her.",
  "102As you have helped Atma and all of us, so shall I help you.",
  "57If you haven't already, tell Atma that Radament is dead. It may help to ease the weight of her mourning.",
  "50They say that the taste of vengeance is bittersweet, but I find it to my liking. \n\nIn addition to my undying gratitude, I have spoken on your behalf with the rest of the townspeople. The merchants have agreed to show their gratitude by offering their wares and services at lower rates.\n\nOh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. You'll find him in front of the palace.",
  "37Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a fortunate turn of events...\n\nAs the last living Horadrim, I alone have knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...\n\nThe Horadric Mages, after binding Baal within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off his Burial Chamber from the mortal realm. Those same Mages also crafted fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued them with the special power to open the Chamber's hidden door.\n\nAfter nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all the Horadric Staves into two parts - wooden shaft and metal headpiece - hiding them separately to safeguard them.\n\nThe Horadrim foresaw our current plight and designed the hiding places to reveal themselves to worthy heroes like you.\n\nCollect both parts of a Horadric Staff and unite them using a Horadric Cube. Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.",
  "50The Viper Amulet you bear is actually the headpiece of a Horadric Staff!\n\nYes... You have an uncanny knack for finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of course, you'll have to use a Horadric Cube to combine the headpiece with the shaft.",
  "56The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my friend. You have discovered the shaft portion of a Horadric Staff.\n\nI trust you know how to use a Horadric Cube to unite the shaft with its headpiece.",
  "40You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to Horadric lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff.\n\nTo do it - use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and use the Cube's transmute power.\n\nYou'll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well...\n\nSix gems plus one sword transmute into a socketed long sword.\n\nYou may also transmute two quivers of crossbow bolts into one quiver of arrows, while two quivers of arrows yield one quiver of bolts.\n\nI must leave it to you to discover other formulae.",
  "46Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff.\n\nCarry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. Find within the Tomb the chamber whose floor is inset with the Circle of Seven Symbols.\n\nPlace the Staff into the receptacle you find there. That will open the secret passage into Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.\n\nBut, be prepared for a fight - you'll likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy Baal.",
  "110My astrologers failed to predict this eclipse. You should seek Drognan's advice.",
  "71This midday darkness reeks of foul magic! My men and I are trying to keep the peace, but this kind of thing really scares people.",
  "65Two men arrived late last night bearing a story about evil magic. They said they saw a gathering of giant snake creatures performing some arcane ritual. They sound like the Serpent Men of the desert.",
  "72The sun has grown disgusted with the terrible deeds it must shine upon each day. Damnation is upon us all.",
  "121Drognan, the wizard, will have some idea as to what is happening.",
  "100This whole place is one big ale fog.",
  "70This unnatural nightfall is no doubt caused by evil sorcery. Drognan might know what we are dealing with.",
  "65Claw Vipers! This outer darkness mirrors the inner blackness of their souls. It is they who have eclipsed the sun, I'll wager. They are a venomous band.",
  "77I've been researching this lengthy eclipse and I believe it to be the work of Claw Vipers.\n\nFind their temple beneath the desert sands and you may find the source of this curse.",
  "76This permanent darkness is very unsettling. Hmmm... It would make navigation by stars easier for me, though.",
  "62Drognan may have some advice on this matter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with him myself.",
  "130This eclipse is a definite manifestation of evil.",
  "73Don't worry! My men and I have an iron grip on this town. If those cursed Claw Vipers are plotting anything against us, we'll be prepared for 'em.",
  "73The calculated coldness of the reptilian brain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny adversaries.",
  "49It's strange when the morning after the night before... is still the same night.",
  "105I've had about enough of this darkness. I don't even know what day it is anymore.",
  "77The Claw Vipers practice evil magic. They have also been known to kidnap travelers and sacrifice them to their dark gods.",
  "82Well... I don't know much about the habits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. Drognan will probably know something about the nature of the magic at work.",
  "51I've discovered a reference to a similar eclipse several hundred years ago. It says that some desert-dwelling snake demons had erected an evil altar, which caused the sun to go black.\n\nPerhaps we are dealing with something similar here. Look for an altar in the Claw Viper temple.",
  "94I usually charge for rooms by the night.\n\nBut I may have to soon change that.",
  "57The source of this spell is probably a magical altar. It will not be enough to kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the spell you must destroy the altar.",
  "80I was going to go to bed, but then I realized that I have no idea what time it is. It could be the crack of dawn, for all I know.",
  "96The sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm beginning to like you, traveler.",
  "219I'm glad that's over with!",
  "74Ahh... It takes but one eye to revel in the beauty of our restored sun.",
  "60So, this is daylight... It's over-rated.",
  "80With renewed daylight, one may gather the wits that were scattered about like restrictive undergarments in the darkness.",
  "130So... Did you plunder any booty?",
  "132You have done well to restore light to our world.",
  "87Drognan seems to have taken you into his confidence. This is good, for you will benefit from his wisdom.",
  "69Ahhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical artifacts. Did you happen to find one in their temple?",
  "69You did well in destroying the Claw Vipers. We are all glad to see the sun returned to its former glory.",
  "48I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and I sense that he is becoming more and more agitated by something. You should try to talk to him again.\n\nIf he still won't take you into his confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit more. I gather that his respect for you is growing.",
  "41I've been researching the old records, trying to find the location of Tal Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found the Tomb, itself, I may have a good lead for you.\n\nThe great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere around here. He was a powerful spellcaster and kept demons as slaves within the Sanctuary. He kept a close eye on great events, too -- such as the imprisonment of Baal within Tal Rasha's Tomb.\n\nIf you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, I'm sure that it would hold some clue as to the Tomb's location. Though I doubt Horazon is still alive, you must proceed with caution. There's no telling what could be waiting inside.\n\nWhen I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, he asked that I send you to him. Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance or the like.",
  "46Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He believed that he could bend Evil forces to his will. What he didn't know was that Evil uses man, not the reverse.\n\nThe Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol of man's ability to triumph over other worldly forces. The Church of Light, however, cites him as an example of man's folly.",
  "89The only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the harem girls that have been hiding there since the troubles began.",
  "62An 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the palace? I'd heard that there were some underground cellar levels that Jerhyn used as chambers for his treasure and such, but no Arcane Sanctuary.",
  "44When the troubles began here, I allowed the terrified Harem guilds to join me within the safety of the palace. All was fine, until one night...\n\nScreams echoed up the stairwells from the harem. My guards arrived to find the poor girls being slaughtered by a merciless band of hell-spawned demons. My brave guardsmen tried to push the demons back into the mysterious rift from which they came.\n\nEver since, my men have fought a losing battle. Demons have continued to pour through the rift into the palace. Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his mercenaries to help protect the rest of my fair city.\n\nDrognan believes that the Arcane Sanctuary lies buried underneath this palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.\n\nMy palace is open to you now... Take care.",
  "45I very much doubt that Horazon still lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed great power and influence over demons, but even that may not have been enough in the end. One of his notoriety cannot easily remove himself from the vengeful reach of Hell.",
  "60Look, look... I'm just about as tough and arrogant as they come, but you'd never catch me trying to tame a demon for a pet. That's just asking for a lot of trouble.",
  "75Arcane Sanctuary? That place sounds awful! Even if you find a way into it, what makes you think you'll be able to leave again?",
  "73A careful caravan gives wide berth to sleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, let him remain so.",
  "49Horazon found it necessary to lock himself up for all time, just to protect himself from those angry demons. Such is the fate of one who practices the summoning arts... that, or eternal damnation. There's old summoners and bold summoners, but no old, bold summoners.",
  "42Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage clan. Horazon used the knowledge of the Vizjerei to summon and control demons from Hell.\n\nThough a powerful Summoner, Horazon feared that the Lords of Hell would punish him for enslaving their brethren. Thus, the Summoner created for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.\n\nHe believed that his Sanctuary would not only protect him from Hell's vengeance, but also allow him to continue his studies free from the ravages of time and disease.\n\nHorazon had crafted many wondrous scrying devices through which he observed the events of the world outside. It is certain that he took careful study of Tal Rasha's imprisonment and recorded the location of his forgotten Tomb.\n\nThe Arcane Sanctuary was believed to have been constructed here in Lut Gholein. An entrance may be hidden somewhere in the palace, as that building is very old, and was once a Vizjerei fortress.",
  "57Ahh... The legend of Horazon is an old one, especially around these parts. You wouldn't believe the feats and strange events that are attributed to him.",
  "63I understand that you've been talking to Jerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first in a long while... since the trouble began, actually.\n\nDo us a favor and try to find out what's got Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?",
  "48There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, I believe... who visited me almost a year ago. He was very interested in the history of this site, and he seemed particularly fascinated with the palace architecture.\n\nI gave him a tour. When he found the ancient seals over a passageway in the cellar, he became very agitated. He asked for some time alone to study them, and I granted it.\n\nShortly after, he left with no further word and I never saw him again. Odd... Don't you think?",
  "61What's got you so occupied in the palace? Don't tell me you're finding the Harems more compelling than killing demons? That would be out of character for one such as yourself.",
  "63I am certain that you will find the information you need when you find Horazon's Journal. I suggest you find it quickly, for Diablo may be getting closer to freeing his brother as we speak.",
  "68Huh? The horizon is always out of reach, you should know that. Oh, Horazon! Oh, I see. Uh.\n\nYes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, but... total lunatic.",
  "57Even a sanctuary such as Horazon's can be breached by the tentacles of Evil. Such a haven could have become a chamber of unspeakable horrors. Be wary of what you may unleash!",
  "49All my years of brawling, of pummeling both the unsuspecting and the deserving, have yielded two insights. You can either fight or you can run. All other strategies are variations of these.",
  "77So... Now that you're such a pal of Jerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can set sail one of these days? I'm running out of patience.",
  "87So you've been in the palace, have you? Tell me, why does Jerhyn keep that place locked up so tight?",
  "87Fate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt you with dung if you mock it.",
  "51I've been thinking about the problems in Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has occurred to you as well...\n\nIf those cellar passageways lead to the Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where the demons came from. Horazon's haven must have been breached!",
  "37Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will find it through the Portal. But know that the glowing glyphs recorded here in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs of the six False Tombs.\n\nThe missing Seventh Sign marks the Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim he might be called the foremost.\n\nIt was a shining - but brief - moment for the Mage Clans when they set aside their differences and worked together against the common enemy.\n\nThe Horadrim relentlessly pursued the Three across the desolate Empires of the East, and even into the uncharted lands of the West, leaving the Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.\n\nPresuming the Three to be vanquished, the Horadrim's unstable fellowship began to dissipate. Abandoning their sacred charge to safeguard the three Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans began to squabble amongst each other over petty differences.\n\nTheir conflicts not only dissolved their brotherhood, but strengthened the Evils which they had buried beneath the cold earth.",
  "59Unbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! The palace guards have been fighting off demons from the cellar. How could that happen without my knowledge?",
  "62I thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also glad that you found something you were looking for. The journal should help you find the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Hopefully, there is still time to get there before Diablo.\n\nGo now. And good luck.",
  "55You have found Horazon's Journal. Excellent... But, I must caution you.\n\nThe mark of the True Tomb of Tal Rasha, is sought, if not already known, by Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the implications of that.",
  "71News of the tragedy in the palace is spreading fast. How awful! And to think, this whole time I thought Jerhyn and his guards were in there playing with the harem girls.",
  "60Hah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the palace. I would've saved those girls and kicked demon ass back to the fire-pits o' Hell!",
  "52So... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. Well... I guess I can see why he wanted me to stay, though... I'm just glad it didn't come to that. Now he tells me to wait some more, in case you need to get out of here.\n\nWell, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll mention me in the epic ballads, eh?",
  "67Well, the news going around town is very unsettling. Apparently, we were in more danger than anyone thought.\n\nGood work friend... you may have saved all our skins.",
  "64Faith is stronger than any armor. The shield will protect the body, but Faith will strengthen the courageous heart.",
  "55Horazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, well... Glad you found it. Such a shame about those poor harem girls, huh? I shall miss them deeply... I mean their conversations, of course.",
  "62Oh, those poor women! Will the slaughter never end? Thank you once again for protecting our city.",
  "57You must move quickly now, friend, for Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal Rasha before he frees the Lord of Destruction.",
  "89That guy really talks like that? Sounds like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy or that's some impostor.",
  "57The man you describe is probably not Horazon.\n\nHe sounds like the very mage who came around here a while ago. He was very curious about this palace and seemed especially interested in the seal on the passageway in the cellar. He left shortly after that. I wonder how he got down there? The seal was never broken...\n\nThat mage spoke a great deal to Drognan. Why don't you ask him about it?",
  "47Yes... The man you speak of sounds like the mage who came here many months ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo in the passages beneath Tristram.\n\nNo doubt the fool wandered into Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever was left of his ravaged mind. He is beyond salvation. \n\nIt is possible that the fool has been possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If that's true, then you'd better put an end to his tortured existence.\n\nOnce done, I believe the demons who were summoned and imprisoned within the Sanctuary will cease to exist as well.",
  "57Ah, yes. I remember. There was a... fellow around here many months ago who asked almost as many questions about Horazon as you.\n\nSo... He discovered enough to assume Horazon's place in the Arcane Sanctuary, huh? What a fool!",
  "72Ah, yes. As a ship captain I am well aware of the phenomenon of a false Horazon.\n\nSorry, just a little joke.",
  "99There's nothing more dreadful than a powerful being driven by a frayed mind.",
  "105You always seem to find the worst trouble. I don't know how you handle it.",
  "38So! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be surprised if he wasn't. All those centuries without ale would drive anyone to drink... but then you couldn't drink. And that would drive you to drink... Hah?... What was the question?",
  "63Hmmm... That doesn't sound like Horazon. I'll agree that he may have gone mad, but from what you tell me, I don't think that's the case. Talk to Drognan... he may know more than I.",
  "106Ugh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.\n\nJust kill him and get on with your business.",
  "45The appearance of the mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one of them.\n\nYou know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the same may happen to you.",
  "76So, Horazon's been dead for some time. I take it you at least found what you were looking for.",
  "60The way I see it... Well, it's all pretty blurry.",
  "63The demonic force that was emanating from the corrupted Sanctuary has dissipated. I thank you greatly for your help. Now, we can look to rebuilding our lives.\n\nAll will be for nothing, though, if you do not stop the greater Evil which is rapidly gaining ground.",
  "83Larger forces are moving inexorably towards us. You must now make haste to the Tombs.",
  "65You make me long for the days of glory. When I had both hands, both eyes and more of a foot...",
  "84I guess you'll be heading to the Tombs now? I hear that they're in the deepest desert regions.",
  "100Well! You've got what you're after. Now get a move on before it's too late.",
  "103Huhhh... Such is always the fate of those who meddle with evil.",
  "89You're more the hero than I could have dreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us after all.",
  "74I feel no pity for that would-be Summoner. His terrible ambition for demonic power was his undoing. You merely hastened the inevitable.",
  "48I hope that this false Summoner found peace in death. Unfortunately, it is more likely that he will be dragged down into Hell by the demons he was bound to.\n\nLet this be a lesson to you... Demonic magic is a quick path, but its powers are seductive and deadly.",
  "45I have heard of your many deeds of skill and bravery. I feel I can trust you with something I have been hesitant to speak of...\n\nDrognan and I have concluded that the Dark Wanderer who passed through here recently was Diablo, himself! Drognan believes that Diablo is searching the desert for the secret tomb where the great Horadric mage, Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.\n\nYou must find Diablo and put an end to the terrible evil that has fallen upon our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to have some helpful advice for you as to how Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.\n\nIt may take you quite some time to find The Tomb. May you be ready when you do.",
  "53It is well-known that there are seven great Horadric tombs hidden beneath the sands in the furthest reaches of the desert. One of them surely must be Tal Rasha's prison. You must explore each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's exact location.\n\nOf course, Diablo is searching for the Tomb as well... No one can guess as to what terrors he has unleashed in his search.",
  "59So... You're going to search for the Seven Tombs, huh? Don't you know that they're just desert legends passed between merchants and travelers? No one really believes that they exist.",
  "61Be very careful, my friend. I think I've seen enough recently not to doubt that these Tombs exist. And if they do, they're most certainly guarded by terrible creatures.",
  "67I've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal Rasha, but I thought they were just old tales meant to scare young children.",
  "59Ohh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... But... umm... I don't like all that living dead stuff.",
  "84I'm sorry, I can't help you much here. Now, if the tombs were across the ocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.",
  "57Legend has it that Tal Rasha lies imprisoned within his tomb, forever struggling to keep the Lord of Destruction bound. His was a selfless act, although perhaps foolhardy.",
  "56When Tal Rasha chose to embody the spirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to wrestle eternally against the will of the greater Evil. Look around you and ask yourself, 'Has the battle been won or lost?'",
  "55Tal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the desert among six others. Tal Rasha's symbol marks the True Tomb. If you want to know what that symbol is, you should be able to find it within the legendary Arcane Sanctuary.",
  "57Diablo nears his goal. We have little time to lose.\n\nRemember, my friend, that Andariel gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. It would be prudent to assume that the other Evils will attempt to aid their master as well.",
  "106If you're going into the deep desert, why not hire a few of my men to watch your back?",
  "47You have done very well. Few could have come this far, let alone discover the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded your grasp. This is most unfortunate...\n\nIf you wish to travel East, I have authorized Meshif to give you passage by sea. I imagine he should be very anxious to leave by now.\n\nGood luck on your quest, and thank you again for saving my beloved city. You will always be welcome in Lut Gholein, my friend.",
  "71I heard that Diablo has managed to best you, at least for the time being. I hope you catch up with him soon, and send him back to Hell for good!",
  "70I'm sorry things didn't turn out as you had hoped. Go and remember us fondly. You know, you bothered me far less than most.",
  "64You have proven to be the greatest of heroes, and I am honored to call you friend. Thank you for bringing peace to our lives again.",
  "68Never fear, my friend. You did the best you could.\n\nI suspect that Diablo and Baal are now heading east, towards Kurast. You'll find them... I know you will.",
  "46This is terrible news! Baal is in possession of one of mankind's most powerful mages, and the Lord of Terror guides his path. They must be stopped, for I am sure they mean to free their elder brother Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who lies imprisoned under the corrupted city of Kurast.\n\nI fear you are walking into a great evil, but your faith can save you. May you walk in the light always.",
  "54You're an inspiration! And such a hero that it makes me look twice as bad...\n\nAhh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some glory for us little guys, huh?",
  "51This is a serious setback... It is most unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been consumed by Baal's destructive influence. There are many secrets known to the Horadrim, which could be used by Baal against us.\n\nYou must travel east by sea to Kurast and stop Diablo and Baal before they free their eldest brother, Mephisto.\n\nHahh... The lands of the eastern Empire are not the same as they used to be. There has been little word for some time.\n\nSpeed is of the essence. Go quickly, my friend. May the fates smile on you.",
  "82Jerhyn tells me I should take you east to Kurast. I haven't been there for several years, but rumor has it that things are pretty grim.",
  "51I've heard that your foe got away from you this time. Well, look at it this way... you've got the demons on the run. If you're going to be leaving, then... Well, thanks for your help.",
  "39The Archangel Tyrael was the one who gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim two hundred and sixty years ago.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the forces of Heaven to so directly interfere with man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to act of his own volition. We have never been able to discern why.\n\nPerhaps, he goes against the consensus of Heaven because he doubts our ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, he sees more threat than his peers.\n\nWhere the actions of Hell often seem straightforwardly bent on destruction, the motives of Heaven are unfathomable.\n\nNow make haste... Both Diablo and Baal must be stopped before they join with their brother, Mephisto. If the three Prime Evils unite once again, the world as we know it will be no more.",
  "48Greetings, hero. I've heard of your exploits and... I'm quite impressed. Very few mortals are capable of dealing with the Three and their minions as you have.\n\nMy name is Natalya. I am a hunter of Evil, part of an ancient Order sworn to hunt down corrupted sorcerers.\n\nIf I could, I would gladly join your quest to stop the Three. But I must wait here for further news. I can't predict what will happen, but the danger is greater than we can know.\n\nUntil I receive my orders, I'll assist you with the information I have.",
  "74Asheara...? Oh, she's is a tough-talking mage, but I'd wager she's never faced true Evil.\n\nPampering drunken mercenaries is one thing, but standing face to face with a hell-spawned demon is another.",
  "69I've heard the name of Deckard Cain many times. He's the last of the Horadrim, and thus, I must honor him. You must be powerful, indeed, if one such as he accompanies you.",
  "100Hratli is a master craftsman. My Order could make use of one with his unique skills.",
  "67My Order has been keeping watch over Ormus for many years, now. He seems to champion the cause of good, but who knows what shadow lurks within his soul?",
  "45I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for many years. But I never would have imagined it could be so corrupted.\n\nCertainly, this must be Mephisto's work! You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo and Baal are still out there and you must find them.",
  "62Seeing his homeland in such a state must be horrifying to Meshif. I'm surprised he's willing to remain here in order to help you.",
  "82Asheara seems like a very tough woman. I'd be careful around her if I were you.",
  "53Drognan told me of Hratli when we were in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves magic into his forge and produces mystical weapons and armor.\n\nHis skills could be quite useful to you. ",
  "44Judging from his dress and strange markings, I would guess that Ormus is from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet none of the others here seem to know that he is a sorcerer.\n\nThe Taan were once as powerful as the Vizjerei clan, but their studies were even more secretive. I wonder what he's hiding.",
  "49Have you met, Natalya? She appears to be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a secret order that has been around for centuries... almost as long as the Horadrim, itself.\n\nHer presence here makes me uneasy, for they are traditionally sworn to hunt down Magi who have betrayed the trust of their order.\n\nI wonder why she is here.",
  "73Ormus would like you to think him mad. Better to watch his actions than listen to his words.",
  "33Welcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come willingly to this ancient city anymore. I hope you brought your wits with you, for sanity is in short supply here.\n\nMy name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure to help you... I don't have many customers these days.\n\nAs you can see, the populace has been brutally decimated by the forces of Mephisto. The canals run red with blood and demons roam the land.\n\nThe wretched jungle-hell has already reclaimed much of Kurast. The only safety you'll find is here at the dockside, where a magical warding holds the jungle evils at bay... but I don't know how long it will last.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Children of Zakarum are in league with the forces of Mephisto. The Zakarum have concentrated their power in the Temple City of Travincal, located within Kurast deep in the jungle wilderness.\n\nIt's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are nothing more than the twisted puppets of a hidden hand.",
  "33Welcome to Kurast, young Sorceress. Few come willingly to this ancient city anymore. I hope you brought your wits with you, for sanity is in short supply here.\n\nMy name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure to help you... I don't have many customers these days.\n\nThough my own magic is only useful for making enchanted weapons, I'll bet yours will put an end to this terrible evil once and for all. May the spirits of Skatsim watch over and protect you.\n\nAs you can see, the populace has been brutally decimated by the forces of Mephisto.

  "48You're very brave to have come here. In the old days, mages who didn't belong to one of the great Mage Clans were hunted down as renegades. But now, the Mage Clans have little authority.",
  "53Within the Temple City stands a tower built long ago by the Horadrim to imprison the... Well, you'll discover more about it soon enough.",
  "60If you are another follower of Zakarum, I've told you people before I don't want your Towering Spire or anything else you have to sell!",
  "74Some find my prices unreasonable. That is because I am unreasonable.",
  "76You'll find that the Zakarumites have the persistence of zombies, but without the charisma.",
  "60Asheara leads the mercenary company known as the Iron Wolves. You can hire some of them, but many are occupied securing the dockside.",
  "74Alkor is a potion dealer given over to a life steeped in ceaseless study and dissipation.",
  "58Ormus is a man of many mysteries. I sense strong magic about him, but he's never spoken of it to me.",
  "49I trust you already know Meshif. But did you know that he was born and raised here?\n\nI suspect that like many of us his spirit is near broken at the sight of Kurast's decline. Only our brand of gallows humor saves us from utter despair.",
  "55This Cain whom you brought with you. He has the bearing of great power, yet I sense no magic about him. He is an enigma to me.",
  "49Natalya is a quiet one. She arrived here about a week ago and has pretty much kept to herself. She's inquired about my weapons a few times, so I assume that she's a warrior of some sort.",
  "51Well, I gave you my word, and brought you here as promised.\n\nBut by all that's still holy, I wish I'd never returned to this accursed place. This fetid jungle can't be the fair Kurast I left behind.\n\nI don't know what all this evil is, my friend, but it's obvious that you must stop it. I only pray that you can before the jungle consumes the last vestiges of my beloved homeland.",
  "47Being a Barbarian, I'm sure you've seen many strange sights in the northlands.\n\nBut by all that's still holy, I wish I'd never returned to this accursed place. This fetid jungle can't be the fair Kurast I left behind!\n\nI don't know what all this evil is, my friend, but it's obvious that you must stop it. I only pray that you can before the jungle consumes the last vestiges of my beloved homeland.\n\nIf this evil isn't contained, it could spread north to your homeland, too. Then the whole world would fall under the shadow of the Three.",
  "63It takes great courage and generosity to defend a land and a people that are not your own. Perhaps, when this curse is lifted, my people can do something for yours in return.",
  "72I shouldn't have boasted so much about Kurast on the journey here. Oh... Much has changed since I left.",
  "99The dockside is apparently the only civilized area left in Kurast.",
  "88If you are planning to carry on your wild ways here, you may need the assistance of Asheara's Iron Wolf mercenaries.",
  "75Your companion, Cain, must have known that he would be in grave danger here. You are great, indeed, to elicit such loyalty.",
  "81Hratli seems to be the only one left here with any common sense. Yet how sensible is it to remain here?",
  "80I went to speak with old Alkor, but I disturbed his studies. He doesn't seem to like visitors.",
  "73Trying to get information out of Ormus is like straining water from a rock. His damned riddles are almost as confusing as our current state of affairs.",
  "75That woman, Natalya, seems to be waiting for something important to happen. She's a strange one, I think.",
  "68All through my childhood, Kurast was a paradise. The once perfumed air now reeks of putrefaction.",
  "54Hello, there. You must be a great adventurer to risk coming here.\n\nMy name's Asheara, and I lead the mercenary band of mages known as the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting down demons in the jungle for months, but no matter how many of them we kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this whole place has been overrun by evil.\n\nRumor has it that you've come here to help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire some of my mercenaries.\n\nBut be careful... If you piss them off, they can be worse than those monsters out in the jungle.",
  "50Hello, there. You must be an Amazon. I've heard about your people... nomadic warriors without peer.\n\nMy name's Asheara, and I lead the mercenary band of mages known as the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting down demons in the jungle for months, but no matter how many of them we kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this whole place has been overrun by evil.\n\nRumor has it that you've come here to help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire some of my mercenaries.\n\nBut be careful... If you piss them off, they can be worse than those monsters out in the jungle.",
  "66Your skills are unique indeed. They are neither sorcery, nor physical, but seem to be a harmonious blend of the two. The Iron Wolves could learn much from your kind.",
  "160Why fight fair, when you can hire some of us?",
  "107No one comes to Kurast anymore without good reason.  You must be seeking fame and fortune.",
  "137The Iron Wolves and I have made a good living around here lately.",
  "110The jungle can take you down fast. Try to avoid getting trapped out there if you can.",
  "90Hratli may be a bit too clever for his own good. Still, I'd trust his work anytime.",
  "77Hratli thinks he's so funny. The other day he said, 'Asheara, I don't recognize you without that big gash on your face.'",
  "97Meshif says he used to live here. I'm surprised he came back. I'll bet he wishes he hadn't.",
  "78I invited Natalya to join the Iron Wolves and she began lecturing me about the 'dangers of magic'. Who the hell does she think she is, anyway?",
  "61Damn it, I wish you people would just leave me alone! I...\n\nOh, you're new here, aren't you?\n\nI am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in potions and salves, and I can sell you some if you really need them.\n\nBut don't make a habit of coming here. I don't like to be disturbed while I'm studying!",
  "48Damn it, I wish you people would just leave me alone! I...\n\nOh, you're a Necromancer, aren't you? I've heard that your kind use powerful potions and such to wake the dead and control spirits. I'd love to discuss what components you use some time.\n\nI am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in potions and salves, myself, and I can sell you some if you really need them.\n\n...Feel free to drop by anytime.",
  "55Even I can tell that the evil in the jungle is growing. I hope you survive out there, my pasty friend. I'd still like to discuss what components are best used in necromantic potions.",
  "151Care to take a gander at my Grimoire?",
  "90I've never claimed that you'd live forever after trying one of my potions! Merely that you might look as though you had.",
  "105I keep a library of tomes - heretical, exegetical, hermeneutical and pharmaceutical.",
  "50There was a very fat man here recently asking after the Golden Bird of Ku Y'Leh. Have you heard of it? He kept muttering about ashes. I would imagine one Golden Bird's ash-hole to be about the same as another, wouldn't you?",
  "150I hope you don't object to my badgering the witless.",
  "115You came here with Meshif? That old 'tour-guide to the stupid'!\n\nI'm surprised you made it here in one piece.",
  "98Oh, Asheara's a good customer. She buys a potion of manliness from me every week.",
  "82Hratli's only good for making his silly magic weapons. It's not like he's got the stones to actually go out and use them on anything.",
  "88Oh, Ormus has been talking in riddles for years. I think he does it to cover up the fact that he's got nothing intelligent to say.",
  null,
  "38You now speak to Ormus.\n\nHe was once a great mage, but now lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You have questions for Ormus and doubt in yourself. Ormus sees a strange dichotomy in you... as he does in all would-be heroes.\n\nSpeak to him and he may grant you wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and seek wisdom in thyself.",
  "37You now speak to Ormus, good Paladin.\n\nHe was once a great mage, but now lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You have questions for Ormus and doubt in yourself. Ormus sees a strange dichotomy in you... as he does in all would-be heroes.\n\nSpeak to him and he may grant you wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and seek wisdom in thyself.",
  "68The Church which you serve is corrupted by evil. Yet the holy disciplines it taught you may yet save us all.\n\nThis is a strange time for heroes, Ormus thinks.",
  "65Your salvation can only be reached through Hatred. A strange fate, but a true one.",
  "52How does one destroy Destruction? How does one force Terror to flee in fear? You have great tasks ahead of you, Ormus thinks.",
  "72The Church of Light harbors the darkest shadow of all. Tread lightly.",
  "89When speaking of the dead, it is best to remain cryptic.",
  "84The Travincal can be breached by the loss of one's wits, not by the use of them.",
  "95Alkor is able to explain things much more clearly than Ormus.",
  "58For one who spends so much time away from home, Meshif has taken Kurast's corruption the hardest.",
  "91Asheara is both proud and self-conscious of her womanhood.",
  "65Deckard Cain... Ormus has no time for the last son of the Horadrim. Pride led that holy Order to failure.",
  "63Hratli suspects that Ormus is a mage. He can suspect whatever he wants, Ormus will not show him the true magic.",
  "53Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he collected an odd assortment of such small statues.\n\nI would show him your figurine. ",
  "160Only Deckard Cain can make sense of this.",
  "73Praise you! That jade figurine will complete the set I was collecting.\n\nHere! I've had this statuette of a golden bird for years, but I consider it a fair exchange.",
  "89I'm having fun just watching you run from place to place searching for a Golden Bird. Some hero you are.",
  "47I've read legends about a sage named Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of life beyond death.\n\nIf I remember correctly, his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.",
  "134You will have to take Ku Y'leh's ashes to Alkor.",
  "96Such a beautiful statuette... But, you'd think it would've been better cared for. There's a compartment here that's full o' dust.",
  "73Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank you, my friend. \n\nBusy yourself while I experiment with the ashes within it. Then, return and see what I have made for you.",
  "51Ku Y'leh, in searching for immortal youth, found only an early death. His apprentices, seeking to live forever, burned his body in order to derive benefit from his ashes.",
  "50Ku Y'leh was a powerful sage who was rumored to have brewed a potion of immortality. In an ironic twist of fate, he was murdered before his potent elixir could take effect.",
  "78Don't tell me you believe in all of that 'life after death' nonsense. You should be more concerned with avoiding death than making plans for after it finds you.",
  "120From the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed for you a potion.",
  "94Immortality is definitely not for me.\n\nCan you imagine having to wake up every night just to piss for the next thousand years?",
  "63So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all along. I wonder if he knows what he gave up for that jade figurine.",
  "54Ormus remembers the tale of Ku Y'leh. That venerable sage forgot that there is no life beyond death. There is only life.\n\nOnce prolonged unnaturally, it can become a living hell.",
  "67I must admit, your foolish quest made little sense to me. But now I see the value of your actions. I believe you do possess great wisdom.",
  "33Never forget that your ultimate purpose here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian Tower that is located within the Temple City of Travincal.\n\nKnow this, friend. The only way to gain entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy the artifact known as the Compelling Orb.\n\nMephisto used this device to control the Zakarum Priests and their followers. The Orb can only be destroyed with an ancient flail imbued with the spirit of the one incorruptible priest.\n\nSoon after his imprisonment, Mephisto worked his evil corruption on the Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the Que-Hegan of the High Council.\n\nMephisto directed the other Council priests to slay and dismember Khalim and then scatter his remains across the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, eventually becoming the embodiment of Mephisto here on the mortal plane.\n\nThe corrupted High Council fashioned an Orb to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to hide the lair of their master from mortals.\n\nYour task is to collect the scattered relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his relics.\n\nOnce this is accomplished, you must destroy the Compelling Orb with Khalim's Will to open the way into the corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.",
  "61You have found Khalim's Heart, and it still bears the courage to face Mephisto!\n\nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Brain, and the Flail.",
  "52Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto.\n\nPlace the Eye in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.",
  "58This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain knows Mephisto's weakness.\n\nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Heart, and the Flail.",
  "46Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal the way to Mephisto.\n\nPlace it into the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute them to carry out Khalim's Will.",
  "54Masterfully done, hero! You have crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to destroy the Compelling Orb and open the way to Mephisto. \n\nMay the true Light guide your way.",
  "56It pains me to waste time with you, so I'll get right to the point.\n\nThere is a very special book which you must find for me. It was written long ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who studied Skatsimi magic and the effects of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. The Black Book was lost when the Children of Zakarum took over this land.\n\nNow, you must reclaim it without delay! Its knowledge may aid us in this dark time ahead.",
  "73The Black Book contains powerful secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, long eclipsed by Zakarum.\n\nI should warn you. The Black Book is much sought after by both good and evil. Be wary.",
  "62The Children of Zakarum believe that the Black Book is filled with blasphemous heresy. In truth, the book may contain the secrets to our ultimate redemption.",
  "73Oh. No one really believes that the Black Book exists. It's just a symbol of Zakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda.",
  "102Many things can be found in the city of Kurast. The book may be there.",
  "54We have long sought the Black Book of Lam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts spread as fast as jungle plagues. If you find it, take it to Alkor.",
  "72The Black Book is a powerful source of information. The Zakarum will do everything in their power to stop you from obtaining it.",
  "81I've heard of the Black Book. My Order's code is based on many of its passages. If you find it, I will be greatly impressed.",
  "104Did I neglect to mention that the book contains useful information about the Prime Evils?",
  "55Even if you find the sacred Book, you must still traverse the jungle of meaning within it. That journey could prove to be far more perilous.",
  "56Kurast was once the greatest city in the world. Now it is hard to tell where the jungle stops and the city begins. The jungle grows rampant on the soil enriched by the blood of my fellow citizens.",
  "68I believe I can trust you now.\n\nWhen you first arrived, I suspected you a spy for the Zakarum, the false religion whose faithful are now under the sway of a mysterious power. They've made a mockery of the Old Religion of Skatsim.",
  "62Not getting much help?\n\nYou know, people are like rugs. Hang them out a window and shake 'em a couple times. You'll be surprised how much dirt comes out.",
  "81I heard that there are ruined temples in Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black Book in one of them.",
  "105I hope you find the Black Book soon. I could use something to read while I wait for my orders.",
  "83You have found the Book! It should give all of us here some insight into the nature of the Prime Evils...\n\nAh, but as for you...",
  "70Why is the Black Book of Lam Esen like a coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape of our future.",
  "75Thank all that's holy. You've returned with the Black Book! Maybe now you can put an end to the Evil that has destroyed my homeland.",
  "135The Iron Wolves are very impressed by your skills.",
  "74We have the Book. Now we must see if we can bear its revelations.",
  "86You have found a source of information powerful enough to turn the tide against the Zakarum.",
  "89So, you've returned with the Book. You surprise me. You must be very resourceful.",
  "45As I told you before, I placed an enchantment upon the dockside in order to keep the demons at bay. But lately, the enchantment seems to be weakening.\n\nIf memory serves me correctly, there is a holy Skatsimi blade that could revitalize the enchantment. The blade is called the Gidbinn.\n\nFind it, and our sanctuary here will remain safe.",
  "66Have you not heard of the Gidbinn? Well, allow me to reduce your ignorance on the subject.\n\nThe Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a religious artifact greatly valued by the Old Religion, Skatsim.",
  "64Ormus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But how would a powerful Skatsimi artifact aid an unbeliever like you?",
  "66The Gidbinn is one of the few remaining relics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is reputed to have great powers.",
  "107The Gidbinn will reinforce the enchantments that protect the dockside from the evil that infests Kurast.",
  "54As far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the possession of the Children of Light. They do not wish it to fall into the hands of those who can restore its powers.\n\nYou may not believe it, but Ormus is the one who can use the Gidbinn to protect us.",
  "55I've done some research on the Taan mage-clan, and it seems that most of their magical studies were focused on Skatsimi rites.\n\nIf anyone is qualified to use the powers of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.",
  "73Don't let the Gidbinn's size fool you. Though it is only a small dagger, it holds tremendous power when in the hands of a true Skatsimi mage.",
  "70Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests placed great power within the small blade. Power enough to repel this terrible jungle-curse which encroaches on our sanctuary.",
  "83If we are to have peace from the shadow, you must find the weapon which will destroy the Light.",
  "67The jungle is like nothing you've ever seen before. Imagine Paradise festering like a wound... then bursting!",
  "145I'm certain that the Gidbinn is very closely guarded.",
  "70Once the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will use it to strengthen the protective barrier around the dockside.",
  "75Since you haven't come across the Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper in the jungle nearer Kurast.",
  "97You'd best get back out there and find that blade. The jungle creeps further into this camp by the hour.",
  "77Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade from right under Zakarum's nose! This is a great day, indeed!",
  "41You have done well, noble hero. Ormus congratulates you. The old spirits of Skatsim will watch over you for returning their sacred blade.\n\nNow, after all these years, Ormus will once again use his powers to protect the innocent from the shadow. The spell that protects the dockside shall now be reinforced.",
  "79With any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will grant us revenge upon the powers that ravaged this land.",
  "99Now that fewer of the Iron Wolves are needed to guard the dockside, some of them have volunteered to accompany you free of charge.",
  "80The Gidbinn's magic can only be channeled through Ormus.\n\nTake it to him. He has the necessary knowledge about the ancient Skatsimi magics.",
  "62Who could have foreseen that the Old Religion would play such an effective role in our war against the Three? Again, your efforts amaze me, my friend.",
  "67You are truly amazing, stranger. There are precious few items in the world that would tempt me to go up against the Children of Zakarum.",
  "101This magic ring does me no good.\n\nHere... Wear it proudly!",
  "36You have done well, my friend. Your courage and valor are an inspiration to us all.\n\nBut now the time has come to face those responsible for the evil that has stifled our land. You must destroy the High Council of Zakarum!\n\nLong ago, these elders were charged with the stewardship of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned within the Guardian Tower.\n\nThrough the generations, these pious men slowly fell more and more under the sway of Mephisto's malevolent power and the Council became an evil mockery of its former glory. \n\nIt is Mephisto's Hatred that has corrupted Zakarum and turned its devout followers into paranoid fanatics. That is why you must travel to the Temple City of Travincal and slay the Council.\n\nOnce they are gone, Mephisto's hold over this land and its people will be broken!",
  "84The Black Book contains some vague prophecies regarding this undertaking. I'm not so sure it will turn out well for you.",
  "90I am but a potion dealer and an avid reader of occult books. What do I know of the Travincal?",
  "54You must know that the Guardian Tower in the Temple City was built by the Horadrim for one purpose - to hold Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, you may enter the Tower.",
  "54You must know that the Guardian Tower in the Temple City was built by the Horadrim for one purpose -  to hold Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, you may enter the Tower.",
  "68There is only one way to the Temple City. You will have to cross many rivers and streams, but you'll find it. A great tower stands at its center.",
  "113It has been said that Ormus speaks most clearly when his ideas are utterly mad.",
  "89The Children of Zakarum who guard the Tower square can be killed, but their numbers are vast. You must destroy their Council.",
  "105There are many zealots among the followers of Zakarum. It will be difficult to get past them.",
  "104Remember. You can always find sanctuary here with us.",
  "75This has been a trying time for all of us, but I sense this nightmare is coming to an end.",
  "63Ormus tells me that the Council is comprised of tremendously powerful priests. It will be difficult to best them.",
  "93The Temple City is well guarded. You'd best keep your wits about you.",
  "100You are incredibly brave to venture into the lion's den. I wish you luck.",
  "95Beware the followers of Zakarum. Their fanaticism is their greatest weapon.",
  "111Kill as many as you can. I have a morbid love of excess.",
  "91If only we could have found the Black Book. I feel as though a malevolent hand has led us away from it.",
  "49If you die on this quest, I will commemorate your sacrifice in an epic poem. You will not need a potion to achieve immortality. Ormus' words will do that.",
  "110Within the Temple City is a courtyard. The Council resides there.",
  "107I have heard rumors that the Prime Evils are here seeking their Brother.",
  "161The Iron Wolves and I are at the ready to aid you.",
  "139Things are getting wilder than Ladies Night at the Slippery Fist.",
  "65The followers of Zakarum demand complete allegiance to their creed. They have slaughtered many of their own for minor grievances.\n\nThey will not hesitate to kill you.",
  "75After having served Mephisto all these years, the Council must be twisted by hatred and evil.",
  "81Sankekur may be using a Compelling Orb to control the minds of the Children of Zakarum.",
  "80I respect your need to do this. Honor demands that you see this through. Yet your chances are so slim...",
  "80I respect your need to do this. Honor demands that you see this through. Yet your chances are so slim...",
  "91You've accomplished the impossible! By killing the Council, the curse of Zakarum will be lifted and our land will be free!\n\nOh. Thank you!",
  "40Ormus is grateful to you, stranger. You have broken the long, dark reign of Zakarum and delivered the first paralyzing blow against the Three.\n\nYet still, the true test lies ahead. For he whom the Council guarded still lives within the Blackened Tower.",
  "76It seems the jungle is already dying back. You've broken the curse, my friend! May the Light bless you!",
  "125The sun has set on the Religion of Light.",
  "68The followers of Zakarum lacked all sense of moderation. The collapse of their tainted religion gives me hope.",
  "48Ridding Kurast of the Council of Zakarum was essential. Still, there is more you must do. The Compelling Orb, too, must be destroyed.\n\nDiablo and Baal must be close to finding their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've no time to waste.",
  "88I can hardly believe you did it. Your power blankets you like a shining aura.",
  "53Diablo and Baal have surely found the Temple City by now. They seek to free their Brother, Mephisto, who was imprisoned by the Horadrim in the Temple's Guardian Tower.\n\nYou must reach him before his Brothers do and prevent them from releasing Hatred upon the world.",
  "90The hidden ways of the Tower are long forgotten. Though it is rumored to have been built as far below the ground as above it.",
  "114We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure of his Brothers' whereabouts.",
  "52Make haste! Though the Three are sure to reunite, it is uncertain as to what they have planned once they do.\n\nBe cautious, my friend. Though you are mighty, no mortal can stand alone against the power of the Prime Evils.",
  "52Make haste! Though the Three are sure to reunite, it is uncertain as to what they have planned once they do.\n\nBe cautious, my friend. Though you are mighty, no mortal can stand alone against the power of the Prime Evils.",
  "66Be careful when you return to the Tower. Though many of the followers of Zakarum have fled, there's no telling what horrors still lurk inside it.",
  "116Move quickly, my friend, and end this curse once and for all!",
  "60I sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a scouting mission into the jungle near the Temple City... They encountered two cloaked men who attacked them with horrifying powers.\n\nMy men barely survived. I have to assume that the two strangers are Diablo and Baal.\n\nYou'd better hurry. They're close to finding their brother.",
  "93Many Iron Wolves have disappeared in Travincal. The Evil is still strong there.",
  "43Mephisto, along with Baal, was originally captured in the desert near Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the Brothers together was far too dangerous.\n\nThe Horadrim built the Guardian Tower to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came to power in this land, it took over the Temple City without paying any heed to what was locked within the Tower.\n\nAnd it became their doom.",
  "73I hear there is a little family reunion about to take place in Kurast. The Three brothers draw close.",
  "116You must reach Mephisto before his brothers do.",
  "50The ancient Horadrim always feared that the Three would escape their prisons and unite. I can't believe that I, the last of their Order, have seen it come to pass.\n\nYou are the only one who can prevent this, my friend. The final hour draws near.",
  "75Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't give in to your hatred. That is his greatest weapon against you.",
  "75Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't give in to your hatred. That is his greatest weapon against you.",
  "68Well, the good news is that events are unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. The bad news is that the story ends in our utter ruin!",
  "80I'm afraid both fear and a large dose of elixir preclude me from answering.",
  "59I understand that the great Patriarch of Zakarum, Sankekur, now embodies Mephisto.\n\nYou must overcome Hatred lest Terror and Destruction claim us all!",
  "77I am loath to describe what will happen if Diablo and Baal release Mephisto.",
  "110I ought to return to the ship. We may have to sail from here very quickly.",
  "110I ought to return to the ship. We may have to sail from here very quickly.",
  "80The sudden reduction in our ranks makes us eager to destroy Diablo and his brothers. Vengeance for the Iron Wolves!",
  "200We will fight to the death.",
  "58Why build a Tower to place the beast below ground? At times I believe the Horadrim lacked common sense.",
  "106Shouldn't you be running frantically up and down stairs about now?",
  "96Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto must not escape.",
  "96Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto must not escape.",
  "55Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the most powerful mortal in the world. He controls thousands of fanatical worshippers and embodies the Lord of Hatred, himself. His death will be no easy task.",
  "55Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the most powerful mortal in the world. He controls thousands of fanatical worshippers and embodies the Lord of Hatred himself. His death will be no easy task.",
  "71Your news is great indeed. You have saved us all. I would smile, but I'm afraid my face might collapse.",
  "48You have defeated a Prime Evil in combat. Ormus is impressed beyond words. But staying here will not end this conflict.\n\nYou must enter the Infernal Gate and stop Diablo once and for all.",
  "70Ahh... Now, Kurast can begin the task of rekindling its former glory... I thank you.",
  "65Well done, my friend. You are a great champion of Order. Please, consider yourself an honorary Iron Wolf.",
  "121It looks like you're going to Hell before me.\n\nPut in a good word.",
  "42Our faith in you was well deserved. But Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it is likely that Baal followed him there.\n\nEnter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord of Terror before all is lost. Only then will our world be saved!",
  "55Word is spreading fast that you killed Mephisto. I'd be honored to fight beside you in Hell, but I've just received my mission orders.\n\nI'll be travelling to the Barbarian lands of the North, but I can't tell you why. With luck, our paths will cross again. Farewell.",
  "43It is good to see you again, hero.\n\nMephisto's defeat is a great victory for the Light. I knew that you would eventually find your way here. The Pandemonium Fortress is the last bastion of Heaven's power before the Gates of the Burning Hells.\n\nThis place has been hallowed by the blood of thousands of champions of the Light, many of whom were mortal, like yourself. Now the final battle against the Prime Evils draws near... and you must face it alone. \n\nI have been forbidden to aid you directly, save for a few bits of wisdom. For this is the hour of mortal Man's triumph... your triumph.\n\nMay the Light protect you and the powers of Heaven shine upon your path...",
  "62Long ago, I swore an oath to watch over the Horadrim and their descendants.\n\nAs Deckard Cain is the last of their esteemed Order, I will not allow him to perish here so far from the lands of his birth.\n\nBe at ease, hero, I know that he is your friend. He shall come to no harm.",
  "41Can you believe this place? Did you ever dare to dream that you'd one day stand upon the crossroads between Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium Fortress is truly miraculous.\n\nHowever, your journey is not yet over. Diablo still roams free in Hell, marshalling his demonic forces. Only when he is beaten will our world finally have peace.\n\nHurry now... the sands of time slow for no one! ",
  "48I have read much about the enigmatic Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in Horadrim lore both for his compassion for mortals and his unquenchable spirit.\n\nIt was rumored that he went against the wishes of Heaven and gave the Horadrim the original Soulstones in order to trap Diablo and his Brothers.",
  "72Halt! Before venturing into Diablo's lair, go to the Hellforge with Mephisto's Soulstone.\n\nPlace the stone on the Hellforge and use the Hellforge Hammer to destroy it.",
  "66Proceed, hero, into Terror's lair.\n\nKnow that Diablo's innermost sanctum is hidden by five seals.\n\nOnly by opening each of these seals can you clear your way to the final battle.",
  "42There is a dark, tortured soul who was trapped within this forsaken realm long ago. He was called Izual by mortal men, and in ages past he was my most trusted Lieutenant.\n\nYet, against my wishes he led an ill-fated assault upon the fiery Hellforge, itself.\n\nDespite his valor and strength, Izual was captured by the Prime Evils and twisted by their perverse power. They forced him to betray his own kind and give up Heaven's most guarded secrets.\n\nHe became a corrupt shadow of his former self - a fallen angel trusted neither by Heaven nor Hell.\n\nFor his transgressions, Izual's spirit was bound within the form of a terrible creature which was summoned from the Abyss. His maddened spirit has resided within that tortured husk for many ages now.\n\nIt seems to me that he has suffered long enough. I implore you, hero, find Izual and release him from his cruel imprisonment.\n\nPut an end to his guilt and suffering.",
  "59Though Izual no longer carries the Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may still possess great strength and power within his new form.\n\nAlso, he may not be able to tell friend from foe while in his present state. If you find him, he will almost certainly be hostile.\n\nProceed with the utmost caution.",
  "54Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual the Fallen? He must have great faith in your abilities!\n\nI trust you know what you're doing... Be careful. You're our last hope.",
  "75You mustn't delay, mortal hero. Izual must be put to rest, but Diablo still lurks within this realm.\n\nGo now... Hurry!",
  "83Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel, eh?\n\nYou'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel like some great evil is permeating the air around here.",
  "47Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me!\n\nYou see, it was I who told Diablo and his Brothers about the Soulstones and how to corrupt them. It was I who helped the Prime Evils mastermind their own exile to your world.\n\nThe plan we set in motion so long ago cannot be stopped by any mortal agency.  Hell, itself, is poised to spill forth into your world like a tidal wave of blood and nightmares.\n\nYou and all your kind... are doomed.",
  "53Thank you, hero, for putting Izual's tortured spirit to rest. May the Light protect you and the powers of Heaven shine upon your path.\n\nBut, if what you tell me is true, then I fear that we have been played for fools all along.\n\nIzual helped Diablo and his Brothers trick me into using the Soulstones against them... Now the Stones' powers are corrupted.\n\nWith the combined powers of the Soulstones under their control, the Prime Evils will be able to turn the mortal world into a permanent outpost of Hell!",
  "68You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is imperative that you find and stop Diablo!\n\nYou should speak of this with Tyrael. He will know what to make of this.",
  "53The time has come for you to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone!\n\nTake the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.\n\nOnly by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.",
  "50The time has come to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone! \n\nAlthough I picked it up before entering the Infernal Gate, I believe you should carry out this crucial mission.\n\nTake the Stone to the Hellforge.  Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.\n\nOnly by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.",
  "70Congratulations, hero!\n\nSurely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the fury unleashed when you smashed his Brother's Soulstone.",
  "48The time has come to hunt down and destroy Diablo, himself.\n\nBut beware, the Lord of Terror is not to be underestimated. He single-handedly destroyed the town of Tristram and corrupted the last noble hero who tried to stop him.\n\nThis time, you must defeat him for good. Only by destroying the Soulstone which he carries will his spirit be banished forever.\n\nGood luck! Though this be our darkest hour, it may yet be your greatest moment.",
  "54You don't have time to dally about here!\n\nDiablo awaits you in Hell. Remember... Diablo's greatest weapon against you is Terror.\n\nDon't give in to your fears. Resist his power and put an end to him for good!",
  "48The time has come to hunt down and destroy Diablo, himself.\n\nBut beware, the Lord of Terror is not to be underestimated.

Only by destroying the Soulstone which he carries will his spirit be banished forever.\n\nGood luck! Though this be our darkest hour, it may yet be your greatest moment.",
  "62Praise be to the Light! You have accomplished the impossible!\n\nDiablo and Mephisto have been banished back into the Black Abyss that spawned them and the corrupted Soulstones are no more.\n\nYou've done well, hero. For now, you should rejoice.",
  "42I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You've done a fantastic job.\n\nThough my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I've always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom aided you.\n\nNow, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won't have to see them again for many, many years.",

  "Treasure hunting... pffh. Treasure finding... yes.",
  "Heh. This maiden shall inflict no more anguish.",
  "Let the gate be opened!",
  "My work here is finished.",
  "The evil queen has fallen.",
  "Back to the hell that spawned you, Andariel.",
  "This place disgusts me.",
  "Ugh... The tell-tale stench of a carnivore's lair.",
  "The foul stench of evil assails me.",
  "I sense strange magic here.",
  "I sense a powerful undead being within this place.",
  "Atma has been avenged.",
  "I've just about had my fill of the walking dead.",
  "I pray that Atma will rest easy now.",
  "What a misguided monster.",
  "What a waste of undead flesh.",
  "Great. An eclipse. This just keeps getting better and better.",
  "What is wrong with the sun?",
  "What evil taints the light of the sun?",
  "Only powerful magic can conjure an eclipse.",
  "Only the darkest magics can turn the sun black.",
  "I hope I know what I'm doing.",
  "The sun has never shone here!",
  "Light guide my way in this accursed place.",
  "I sense strong magic within this place.",
  "This place is as dark as a tomb.",
  "Let there be light.",
  "It is good to know that the sun shines once again.",
  "The Light can never be extinguished by evil.",
  "Who would have thought that such primitive beings could cause so much trouble.",
  "What a pity. I was beginning to enjoy the darkness.",
  "Am I the first to find this arcane fortress?",
  "One could get lost in here.",
  "This surely is the product of a twisted mind!",
  "This place actually distorts reality. Fascinating.",
  "This is fantastic! I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension.",
  "What a freak!",
  "Stand aside, old fool. I have no time for your babblings.",
  "Surely the evil here has driven you mad.",
  "Is this truly Horazon?",
  "This bumbling fool cannot be the mighty Horazon!",
  "Good riddance, freak.",
  "Oh, I hate staining my hands with the blood of foul sorcerers.",
  "Rest in peace, tortured soul.",
  "That couldn't have been Horazon. Poor wretch.",
  "It was not Horazon. It was a deluded fool who got too close to true power.",
  "This has got to be the right place.",
  "This tomb is very ornate. This must be Tal Rasha's resting place.",
  "Is this the tomb I seek?",
  "This tomb has Horadric markings. I wonder if this is Tal Rasha's tomb?",
  "This could be Tal Rasha's tomb. However, I'm sensing very strange energies here.",
  "Should I enter...?  Diablo and Baal may have laid a trap...",
  "Such a cold breeze... Tal Rasha must be kept here.",
  "Here, at last, is a fitting testament in stone to Tal Rasha's sacrifice.",
  "This must be the true Tomb of Tal Rasha!",
  "I sense an incredible aura about this tomb. The Horadrim hid something powerful inside.",
  "This is not good. Will this madness ever end?",
  "I have failed. Diablo has freed his accursed brother. The world remains at their mercy.",
  "I shall honor Tal Rasha's sacrifice by destroying all the Prime Evils.",
  "Diablo and Baal have escaped me! Next time... vengeance!",
  "I came too late. Now... Destruction is let loose upon the world once more.",
  "Not in Game",
  "I hope the secrets within this book can help us.",
  "I hope this book is worth all the trouble.",
  "The Black Book... It's heresy to the Zakarum High Council.",
  "This tome has the weight of knowledge about it.",
  "This ancient book radiates arcane power!",
  "All this trouble over a tattered book.",
  "May this book lift the shadow from Kurast.",
  "May the Black Book deliver us from evil.",
  "May the Black Book bring a black day to hell.",
  "Once the book has served its purpose, I shall delve into its secrets.",
  "Whoa.... What died down here?",
  "Cough... The stench down here is choking!",
  "The smell of death... or worse... surrounds me.",
  "It smells worse than rotting reagents down here.",
  "It's been years since I waded through sewers for fun.",
  "I hope this does something good...",
  "This will drain out some of the filth.",
  "This appears to control the ancient valves.",
  "This looks promising.",
  "This looks like what I've been searching for.",
  "Eureka!",
  "Good. Now I can get out of here and get some fresh air!",
  "This trove will help lift the curse from Kurast!",
  "I hope these items can aid me against the demons.",
  "Great. More junk. Just what I'd expect to find in a sewer...",
  "This dagger will separate the faithful from the fallen.",
  "This holy blade does not belong in the hands of the Zakarum.",
  "This blade shall pierce the heart of evil!",
  "I must take this to Ormus.",
  "This is a powerful weapon. Perhaps Ormus can tell me more about it.",
  "What would this bring from the right buyer?",
  "Hmm... what a strange little statue.",
  "Perhaps I could trade this for something more valuable.",
  "I don't sense any magic about this item. Very strange.",
  "A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better.",
  "Such a dark temple for a Religion of Light...",
  "The spirits of nature have fled this dreaded place.",
  "This corrupted temple was once the shining heart of my religion...",
  "I sense tremendous evil within this place.",
  "This temple exudes darkness.",
  "Ah. Skatsim's reign is renewed.",
  "The dark powers here will no longer poison the land.",
  "The Temple shall shine anew with the Light.",
  "The Temple's power is annulled.",
  "The Temple's dark power is broken!",
  "This must be where Mephisto is.",
  "The final resting place of Hatred itself.",
  "This must be where the Horadrim imprisoned Mephisto.",
  "Ah... Mephisto's prison.",
  "The Tower that holds Mephisto....",
  "Mhmm, success! But still, there's something not right.",
  "Maybe now the world will have peace.",
  "The Lord of Hatred shall darken the world no longer.",
  "Mephisto shall no longer darken our souls with hatred.",
  "Good journey, Mephisto. Give my regards to the abyss.",
  "Goodbye, Izual.",
  "Even fallen angels deserve freedom.",
  "How can one who was once so holy fall so far from righteousness?",
  "He was corrupted to the core. I pity him.",
  "Izual was weak. He squandered his infernal power.",

  "40Praise be to the Light! You have accomplished the impossible!\n\nDiablo and Mephisto have been banished back into the Black Abyss that spawned them, and the corrupted Soulstones are no more.\n\nHowever, while you were fighting here, Baal remained behind in the mortal realm, building an army of hellish minions. Now, Baal's army is searching for the Worldstone, the ancient source of all the Soulstones and their power, while leaving behind a wake of destruction. They have forged deeply into the Barbarian homelands, heading directly for the summit of Mount Arreat!\n\nBaal knows, mortal hero! That is the very site of the blessed Worldstone!\n\nNow, enter the portal I have opened for you. It will take you to the Barbarian city of Harrogath, the last bastion of Order on the slopes of Arreat.",
  "40I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You've done a fantastic job.\n\nThough my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I've always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom aided you.\n\nNow, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won't have to see them again for many, many years.\n\nPlease talk to Tyrael about leaving this place now!",
  "35We are the spirits of the Nephalem, the Ancient Ones. We have been chosen to guard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein the Worldstone rests. Few are worthy to stand in its presence; fewer still can comprehend its true purpose.\n\nBefore you enter, you must defeat us.",
  "39I am amazed to find this place so untouched. Everything else in the path of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in ruin. \n\nThese Barbarians must indeed be the legendary guardians of Mount Arreat. They are a proud, hardy people. Don't expect to be greeted warmly -- strangers here rarely are.\n\nPerhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend some time with the townsfolk and try to understand them better. I'll let you know what I discover.",
  "52With hellspawn, size is no measure of their threat. Demons half the size of men can kill with a gesture, while hellish pack animals trample any who stand in their way.",
  "55Though these Barbarians are known throughout the kingdoms as ferocious fighters, they are also capable of great compassion.\n\nThey have trained throughout history for a battle their legends foretell will decide the fate of the world.",
  "55The angel Tyrael has watched over the guardians of Arreat throughout history. I do not believe that Baal and Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry few souls.\n\nThey are here to settle a conflict as old as time itself.",
  "44During my time with the Horadrim, we often debated the nature of Mount Arreat.\n\nWe knew that the Barbarian clans zealously guarded the mountain as their sacred duty. However, many dismissed their zeal as simple superstition... combined with an inborn hostility toward outsiders.\n\nThose Horadrim who trekked up Arreat were never heard from again... Still, I do not believe they died at the hands of Barbarians.",
  "41All users of the magical arts know of Mount Arreat, but few understand its true nature. It is the nexus of an unfathomable magic.\n\nIt bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction races to its summit with such purpose. I fear for the whole world should Baal gain what he seeks.",
  "59I have spent decades trying to understand the forces at work in this world. But in the face of all that is transpiring, I realize how meager my knowledge is.\n\nI will be of assistance where I can, my friend.",
  "54Though the Elder Council of Harrogath is gone, there are many capable young leaders to take their place.\n\nAnya certainly has enough courage and intelligence to lead them all, if they can survive this catastrophe.",
  "53Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of feminine strength...\n\nShe reminds me of the Zakarum priestesses I knew in my youth. They don't take vows of chastity, you know.",
  "65It is fortunate that this town has such a talented smith.\n\nThe quality of Larzuk's work surely complements your skills. In fact, he would have been quite welcome amongst the Horadrim.",
  "54It is my belief that the Soulstones are at the center of this conflict. If only that fool Marius had not intervened, Baal would still be imprisoned within Tal Rasha.",
  "54You have proven yourself a true hero to me and my people.\n\nThese are dark times, warrior. I hope you can bring an end to Baal's reign of destruction. \n\nOur Council of Elders is gone -- my father, Aust, among them. The one thing that keeps us from total despair is the promise of vengeance against Baal.",
  "45Now that the Elders are all dead, I don't know who will guide our people through this dark time. I was to be next in line after my father, but this burden is too great for me to shoulder alone. \n\nWe are a people of strong blood. I shall do what I can and let fate do the rest.",
  "82Baal's minions are not to be trifled with. In their bloodlust they will sacrifice themselves to destroy you.",
  "60Many outsiders believe that the fantastic stories about our ancestors, the Ancients, are but fables. However, I believe that the Ancients were more than human -- that mankind has fallen from what it once was.",
  "58When I was a child, the Elders told us stories about the mountain and its power... and how the Barbarian people are bound to it as protectors.\n\nBaal is not just taking our land -- with every step he takes up the mountain, he takes a part of who we are as a people.",
  "72I am truly glad you are here, warrior. Perhaps things would be different now if we had asked for assistance from the neighboring kingdoms.\n\nOur foolish, foolish pride...",
  "54My father, Aust, was among those Elders wise enough to see that we would need outside help to deal with Baal's legions. He believed that this conflict would affect the entire world, not just our homeland. He said that Mount Arreat is as necessary to the world's survival as food and water is to our own.\n\nI believe this to be true.",
  "50Qual-Kehk's confidence in his abilities once bordered on arrogance, but in the early days of the siege, he was humbled by Baal. While he saved us from immediate destruction, a third of our warriors were lost.\n\nNone felt those losses more than he. Though he may not admit it, your presence gives him hope, warrior.",
  "78If Larzuk could sing or dance half as well as he smiths, he'd be married by now.\n\n...Just look at those shoulders.",
  "57Nihlathak was the last of our Elders, whose charge it was to safeguard the mountain. He alone tried to guide us through the most desperate time in our history -- but he was just as helpless as the rest of us.\n\nI cannot forgive his betrayal, but I can learn from it.",
  "60Our people believe that the Ancients protecting Mount Arreat have the power to stop Baal. Unfortunately, the Lord of Destruction has shown great power to undermine our faith.",
  "55I am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors were some of the finest craftsmen in Harrogath. \n\nRegretfully, my supplies run lower with every passing day, yet the demons beyond the walls have not weakened. \n\nI fear the time is near when I must put down my hammer and take up a sword, instead.",
  "42So, you're an Amazon. I have heard rumors about your kind. Your unusual weapons could prove a challenge to my skills, but I'm prepared to meet it.\n\nI am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors were some of the finest craftsmen in Harrogath. Regretfully, my supplies run lower with every passing day, yet the demons beyond the walls have not weakened. I fear the time is near when I must put down my hammer and take up a sword, instead.",
  "65I've heard that you Amazons excel at killing from a distance. From what I've seen, that's the best way to deal with Hell's minions. \n\nAre all of your kind so... big?",
  "65Why did you ever leave your beautiful islands to come to this frozen battleground? Perhaps if we both survive this, we'll travel back there together.",
  "75Has that infernal howling been keeping you awake at night, too? Some think it's the howling of animals, but those sounds don't come from any beast I've ever known.",
  "69Demonic forces have been using our own towers and barricades against us. You know, it would be wise to cut the demons down in the open before they can mount those fortifications.",
  "70Nihlathak's despair is infectious -- and his behavior does not befit an Elder of his stature. I think we'd be better off without him.",
  "63I've offered Qual-Kehk my ideas on how to break the siege, but he dismisses them. Is it because I lack scars of battle, or does he think I'm a couple arrows short of a quiver?",
  "64Legend has it that the top of Mount Arreat is guarded by the spirits of our ancestors. Though our people are forbidden to climb to the mountain's summit, some foreign travelers have made the attempt.\n\nNone have ever returned.",
  "66This is a lively town during our victory celebrations. We Barbarians train long and hard from childhood to become warriors, and we celebrate with equal fervor.\n\nYou didn't happen to bring along any ale to trade?",
  "54Every day, one of my friends dies fighting outside the town walls, while I tend my anvil here unscathed. If only we didn't need weapons so badly, I could be out doing my share of the fighting. \n\nGood luck to you, warrior.",
  "56Just so you know... The gold you pay me doesn't line my pockets. Much of it goes to buy the raw metal I need to melt down for weapons and armor. The rest -- well, all I can spare -- goes to Malah and Qual-Kehk for other supplies.",
  "35I, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, the last stronghold of Order on Mount Arreat. You have come to the right place if you intend to defeat Baal the Lord of Destruction.\n\nBaal has laid waste to our mountain and its denizens. His minions continue to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk and his men have proven helpless to stop them. Baal is still out on the mountain looking for something -- but I know not what. \n\nAll of the Elders, save Nihlathak, sacrificed themselves to place a protective ward around Harrogath.\n\nSome of us here, certainly Nihlathak, do not appreciate your presence. We are a proud people, and it is not easy for us to accept aid. I, however, am glad you are here.\n\nIf you need healing or a potion, please come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite his disposition, may be of some assistance with other wares. Finally, Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads Harrogath's remaining forces against Baal.",
  "36A Sorceress... Here in Harrogath?\n\nThere was a time, child, when I thought I was destined to follow your kind's path. However, my powers never developed beyond the simplest of spells. Although I can heal almost any wound with time and energy, there is little I can do to help against Baal.\n\nBut enough of that...I spend too much time in reflection and have forgotten my manners.\n\nI, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, the last stronghold of Order on Mount Arreat. You have come to the right place, if you intend to defeat Baal the Lord of Destruction.\n\nBaal has laid waste to our mountain and its denizens. His minions continue to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk and his men have proven helpless to stop them. Baal is still out on the mountain looking for something -- but I know not what. \n\nAll of the Elders, save Nihlathak, sacrificed themselves to place a protective ward around Harrogath.\n\nSome of us here, certainly Nihlathak, do not appreciate your presence. We are a proud people, and it is not easy for us to accept aid. I, however, am glad you are here.\n\nIf you need healing or a potion, please come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite his disposition, may be of some assistance with other wares. Finally, Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads Harrogath's remaining forces against Baal.",
  "34You have traveled far only to return home to us, Barbarian. Ohh... Much has happened in Harrogath since you left. Our homeland is hardly recognizable with so much evil about.\n\nYet, I've managed to survive so far. You've seen your share of suffering as well, I'm sure. Seeing you again -- alive -- does my heart good. I shall pray that you can help us out of this hell.\n\nBaal has laid waste to our mountain and its denizens. His minions continue to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk and his men have proven helpless to stop them. Baal is still out on the mountain looking for something -- but I know not what.\n\nNihlathak is the last survivor of the Council of Elders, but I'm afraid he has not been himself lately. The other Elders sacrificed themselves to place a protective ward around Harrogath. If Nihlathak is curt with you, it is because he feels responsible for our situation. He does not relish sending more of our people out to die.\n\nSo much has changed since you left that I see little hope for us in this life.\n\nIf you need healing or a potion, please come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite his disposition, may be of some assistance with other wares. Finally, Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads Harrogath's remaining forces against Baal.",
  "53I'm aware of the amazing magical powers a Sorceress can channel. If we survive Baal's wrath, I would be most honored if you could demonstrate and perhaps teach me something of what you know. \n\nI may be old, but I'm not dead.",
  "42I know you and my son, Bannuk, did not part on the best of terms. He did not understand the wanderlust that drove you to leave your homeland. However, even though Bannuk could never admit it to me, as he grew older I could see that same desire in his eyes.\n\nOh... It's a pity I didn't encourage him to go with you. He might still be alive today.",
  "57Though once considered shelter by our people, the Ice Caves offer no refuge from the dark horde. There are creatures there that will freeze your heart before feasting upon it.",
  "107On the battlefield, turning your back on even the dead is unwise.",
  "60This battle plays mind tricks on our warriors. Those fortunate enough to have returned from the mountainside claim to have seen angels in flight.\n\nFly they might, but that certainly does not make them angels.",
  "53Perhaps you have heard the accounts of my son's horrible death at the hands of Baal's minions. He was my last living child...\n\nThe oath of compassion I have taken as a healer extends only to humankind.\n\nCut them down, warrior. All of them!",
  "78The catapults are infernal machines made of demon flesh fused with steel.\n\nBe wary of them.",
  "60Qual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the losses have borne heavily upon him. He is only impatient because he judges the worth of a warrior by action, not words.\n\nYou must prove yourself worthy of his trust.",
  "52Larzuk possesses a good soul, but at times his mind seems quite unsound. \n\nHe once asked me for twenty of my finest sheepskins. He said he would fill them with hot air and float like a cloud above the battlefield to spy on Baal's legions! \n\nI worry the siege has driven him mad.",
  "90Be cautious, warrior.\n\nThough I am an experienced healer, resurrection is beyond my powers.",
  "53I pray for the day when the fields are covered in snow unstained by the blood of our own. Perhaps that day will come soon... Perhaps never...\n\nOh... But I forget myself. How may I aid your quest?",
  "64Your gold is most helpful. Medical supplies for our wounded are scarce and very expensive.\n\nWhen we can find a supplier, oh, we must pay dearly for what we need.",
  "44With the exception of Qual-Kehk, the townspeople do not see what I see -- the massacre we face.\n\nOur bravest, strongest heroes hobble back to me begging for help. I do what I can -- healing and bandaging some, preparing the others for what lies beyond.",
  "43Well, well. The siege has everything in short supply... except fools. \n\nWhy would you seek this place, stranger? Are you a vulture come to loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? \n\nRegardless, this is no place to make a name for yourself. The mountain is ours to protect. It is only a matter of time before Hell's legions are routed.",
  "54Well, well... An Assassin!\n\nHeh, heh... While I am sure we are all grateful for your presence in our troubled town, you need not have made the journey.\n\nI can personally say that your skills are not required here. You would serve your clan better elsewhere.",
  "45Ahhh, a Necromancer.\n\nWhile I admire your courage in seeking out the darker side of magic, we really have little need of your skills. The battle will turn soon enough without your meddling. \n\nYet, I should have expected to see your kind here. You are like a moth to the flame -- drawn to all this death. It feeds you in more ways than one, does it not?",
  "49If you're looking for cases of treacherous magic, Assassin, take a hard look at Larzuk. He was the only one in town who escaped the Red Fever last spring. He claimed his good fortune was due to 'hand washing' before meals.\n\nHmmm... Very suspicious...",
  "48Why would you seek this place, stranger? Are you a vulture come to loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? \n\nRegardless, this is no place to make a name for yourself. The mountain is ours to protect. It is only a matter of time before Hell's legions are routed.",
  "67Qual-Kehk is useless. He has blindly sent our warriors to their deaths, assuming Baal's legions would fight as men do. Of course, everyone knows they do not.",
  "57The demon hordes have grown powerful beyond measure, aided by our foolish mistakes. But I may have found a way to correct those mistakes...",
  "37Oh yes... I remember our warriors as children. Malah would set their broken bones and give them powders for their fevers. Now, they return to her with wounds that will never heal.\n\nI am tired... Please... leave me.",
  "133If you have nothing useful for me, be on your way!",
  "81Anya's father was my good friend. There are so many to mourn... I have no time for you!",
  "53I have long been criticized, but especially of late -- since the deaths of my fellow Elders. Through it all, I have learned one thing. Each man must do what's right, no matter what others may think.",
  "65The Council of Elders always believed itself prepared for the coming of the Three. Obviously, we were not prepared enough.",
  "45I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms of Harrogath.\n\nYou have the look of a warrior... An extra soldier will be useful. But don't expect anyone to mourn if you get yourself killed. \n\nBaal is true to his namesake. He has ravaged through our lands like a merciless plague.\n\nThe protective ward laid down by our lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay, but Baal's siege has taken its toll all the same.\n\nMost of my men are now dead. Others are trapped in the mountain passes.\n\nBut I swear we are not beaten yet! We will fight to the end to protect this mountain!",
  "42A Paladin! I have long heard of your people.\n\nAs a young warrior I even considered the pilgrimage to Kurast. But I was younger then and foolish. My place has always been here -- protecting Harrogath, and Mount Arreat with it.\n\nI am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms of Harrogath.\n\nYou have the look of a warrior... An extra soldier will be useful. But don't expect anyone to mourn if you get yourself killed. \n\nBaal is true to his namesake.

Others are trapped in the mountain passes.\n\nBut I swear we are not beaten yet! We will fight to the end to protect this mountain!",
  "42A Druid in Harrogath! Have things truly come to this?\n\nAfter the Mage Wars, I assumed Druids would never be seen in Harrogath again. You take a big chance coming here! \n\nTo be honest, I have never been comfortable with your shape-shifting kind, but I do respect your search for balance and peace. So, if you trust us enough to enter our gates, I trust you enough to let you stay.\n\nI am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms of Harrogath.\n\nYou have the look of a warrior... An extra soldier will be useful. But don't expect anyone to mourn if you get yourself killed. \n\nBaal is true to his namesake. He has ravaged through our lands like a merciless plague.\n\nThe protective ward laid down by our lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay, but Baal's siege has taken its toll all the same.\n\nMost of my men are now dead. Others are trapped in the mountain passes.\n\nBut I swear we are not beaten yet! We will fight to the end to protect this mountain!",
  "67It would be an honor to have a warrior of the Light fighting side-by-side with my men.\n\nI can see your faith gives you great strength, Paladin, but don't expect it to keep you out of harm's way.",
  "61Harrogath has great need of your powers, noble Druid. However, in the face of this supernatural onslaught, are your natural powers up to the task?",
  "44The death of Malah's son was a great tragedy. He was our finest archer.\n\nWhile leading a successful campaign against Baal's forces, he was impaled on a demon's spear. The wound was such that... Well, even Malah herself acknowledges that quick death was a blessing.",
  "57We have lost many well-trained warriors to Baal's siege machines. Their range is great. Though, they are vulnerable if you close the distance quickly enough.",
  "96Baal's legions seem countless, but slaying their commanders takes some of the fight out of them.",
  "58Early on, parties of our best scouts were ambushed by demons that spawned from the very air around them. Survivors often mentioned a strange creature floating in the distance.\n\nPerhaps taking it down could prevent some nasty surprises.",
  "57This is unlike any battle I have ever fought. While we ration food and water, the demon hordes feast nightly on the flesh and blood of our dead.",
  "48Larzuk is a talented blacksmith, but his head is full of some strange ideas. \n\nJust the other day he came to me with a plan to break the siege. He wanted to fill large pipes with exploding powders and steel balls, then... Well, like I said, strange.",
  "46Our Elders were wise leaders in more peaceful times, but now the survival of our people has fallen to me. My men and I will fight to the death, but there's no way to ensure the outcome.\n\nI used to believe that nothing could break through our guard and assault the holy mountain. I know now that I was horribly mistaken.",
  "45If you're here to defeat Baal, you must prove it!\n\nAs we speak, Harrogath is under siege by Baal's demons. Catapults rain death just outside the town walls.\n\nBaal himself travels up the sacred mountain, having left in charge here one of his most vicious generals, Shenk the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster, he lashes his own minions into suicidal frenzies on the battlefield.\n\nIf you wish to prove yourself to us, destroy the monster, Shenk, that commands those infernal catapults outside Harrogath.  If you manage to do this, return to me.",
  "150Uh... Did I mention there were catapults?",
  "83I believe that stopping the siege on Harrogath is the only way for you to earn the trust of these people.",
  "84You've proven your skill at rescuing fair maidens... but how are you at killing vicious beasts?",
  "77Qual-Kehk and his men have been fighting to break the siege for some time. Where many have failed, you may succeed.",
  "70After so many have died, who are you to think you can accomplish what our proud warriors could not?",
  "66About to face Shenk the Overseer and stop the siege, are you? You should ask Malah to perform your last rites before you go, stranger.",
  "90What's the matter, hero? Questioning your fortitude? I know we are.",
  "105I understand your reluctance, but now is the time to strike.",
  "66Those demons have been out there since before your arrival. Can you do nothing to stop them?\n\nYour task is a simple one, warrior. Find Shenk and destroy him.",
  "64This may not be very encouraging, but you have fared better than the others who passed through those gates.\n\nIn regards to Shenk the Overseer, remember: a general is nothing without his men.",
  "78What are you still doing here? I thought you were going off to die.\n\nGo... Be quick about it.",
  "93So, you still live. You're either quick or a coward.",
  "63You're an even greater warrior than I expected... Sorry for underestimating you.\n\nAs a token of my appreciation, I will craft sockets into an item of your choosing, and from now on, you'll get the best price for all my wares.",
  "60Those catapults were like nothing I have ever seen before. You have prevailed against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is still far ahead of you.",
  "108I was starting to wonder how long it would take you to stop those beasts.\n\nGood job.",
  "94Oh... At last, the siege is ended. You truly are an angel.\n\nI thank you.",
  "65Ending the siege does not earn immediate respect, outsider.\n\nRespect only comes with sacrifice -- something I'm sure you know nothing of.",
  "68So... You managed to stop the siege.\n\nYou are more powerful than I gave you credit for. You have rightfully earned my respect.",
  "58My concerns have turned to my men taken prisoner on the battlefield by Baal's demons. I hate to think what's happened to them.\n\nAs you journey up the mountain, keep your eyes open for my soldiers and bring them back to me if you can.",
  "85Those of my men fortunate enough to escape on their own told me that they were held captive in the highlands and plateaus.",
  "74I know firsthand that captivity is a sad fate for a man. Find them quickly.",
  "85If those men are being treated like I was, you must find them. They won't survive much longer.",
  "73I crafted the swords and armor for Qual-Kehk's men. They were like brothers to me. I can't imagine the pain they must be suffering.\n\nSave them if you can!",
  "84Qual-Kehk's men have been imprisoned for some time. They are certain to be tired and weak.\n\nYou must protect them once you free them.",
  "94You have proven you can take life, warrior, but can you save it as well?",
  "95They say that discretion, not procrastination, is the better part of valor.",
  "78More of my men are still alive out there. I am certain of it!\n\nFind them. Free them from their cages and bring them back to me.",
  "63If you are having trouble finding Qual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to Malah. She healed those who made it back before. Perhaps she would have some advice.",
  "115Well, you found me on the mountain; I'm sure you'll find them too.",
  "76As a kid, I used to play soldier among the barricades on the mountain. There's no easy way through that maze of walls.",
  "67Soldiers who made it back told of a system of barricades placed among the mountain passes. They said that is where the prisoners are held.",
  "52Did you ever stop to think why these demons are capturing Qual-Kehk's men? Why they are attacking us? Have you considered what Baal wants with the mountain?\n\nNo. You've not. You have no idea what you are dealing with.",
  "51Thank you for rescuing my men. They have spoken well of your bravery in battle. Perhaps there is hope for us after all. \n\nIf you wish, you may hire some of my mercenaries that you saved. And please... take this set of runes. I had been saving them for a socketed shield, but I think you'll make better use of them.\n\nBe sure to set them in the right order for their fullest effect.",
  "80You've become a hero to this town, my friend. The shadows have lifted ever since you brought the Light to Harrogath.",
  "107I'm sure those men appreciate the freedom you gave them... as much as I do.",
  "55Since your arrival, Cain has spoken of your deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, defeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At first, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm finding them more believable with every passing day.",
  "73You have inspired the people in this town -- not only those you rescued, but those you've helped in other ways as well.",
  "72So. You brought the lost sheep home to the shepherd. Well done.",
  "43There is a matter which I hesitate to share, but I believe you are the only one who can help me now.\n\nAnya, the young alchemist and daughter to one of our slain Elders, has been missing for some time. She is a strong, crafty woman with a spirit like no other.\n\nOne night, just before your arrival, I overheard her and Nihlathak arguing about her father's death. The next morning she was gone.\n\nNihlathak has his own tale as to where she went and why. Don't believe him! I fear he is at the root of her disappearance.\n\nPlease, if you can, search for Anya and bring her back to us. She'll know what to do about Nihlathak.",
  "94When you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. There is no telling what he will say or do.",
  "59I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak speaks with a venomous tongue and acts as if the entire weight of this town rests upon his shoulders.\n\nPerhaps there is more going on here than we know.",
  "57Anya is an amazing alchemist, especially for her young age. As long as I've known her, she's never let anything stop her from pursuing what she believed in. \n\nI wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is involved. Ever since her father died, they haven't gotten along.",
  "41Anya! Who have you been talking to? Likely it was that meddling Malah. \n\nWell, I'll tell you what really happened. Anya came to me for guidance, after receiving a vision that her mother and younger brother were trapped in the lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had decided to go rescue them. \n\nI told her that her quest was a foolish one and that she would be safer staying within the city walls. However, she is a willful girl and would not listen to me. \n\nThe next morning, she was gone. No one is more distraught than I over losing her. \n\nHowever, if you feel the need to be Malah's errand child, I won't try to stop you.",
  "43Anya's father, Aust, was our wisest Elder. He was killed along with the other Elders who erected the ward that protects this city. The ward has kept Baal's demons out of Harrogath, but at a costly sacrifice. \n\nNihlathak, on the other hand, was the only Elder to escape the demons. Somehow, he alone managed to find sanctuary, while the others died around him.\n\nEver since that day, Nihlathak and Anya have been at odds.",
  "52If it were anyone else, I would assume her dead. However, Anya is not so easily beaten. I know she must be alive.",
  "60Nihlathak's story does sound reasonable, considering what I've heard about Anya. However, the best lies are often hidden within truth.",
  "56As the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is the only person, besides Nihlathak, who has any real knowledge of Mount Arreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our fate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.",
  "46Look, I've told you! She's dead! If you knew what was good for you, you'd concentrate your efforts on saving Harrogath -- not on lost causes like Anya.",
  "81It seems like everyone feels Nihlathak played a part in Anya's disappearance.\n\nWhy would he do such a thing?",
  "56So! That snake Nihlathak was behind Anya's disappearance... and he trapped her with a freezing curse.\n\nHere. Take this potion to Anya and give it to her. That should release her.",
  "54Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen Barbarian, Nihlathak... Perhaps Malah can help you where I cannot.",
  "80Poor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak was a traitor...\n\nIf you find him alive, kill him for me!",
  "70The snake has slipped our grasp! While you were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.\n\nI'll bet Anya knows how to track him down.",
  "50Hero. Nihlathak did this to me!\n\nIf you've come to help me, my only hope lies with Malah.\n\nPlease... Tell her you've found me...",
  "48Thank you so much for bringing Anya back to us. I have devised this spell to increase your resistances as a token of my thanks. I know it isn't much, but I hope you find it helpful.\n\nPlease go talk to Anya. She has urgent news concerning Nihlathak.",
  "62For one so young, Anya commands great respect. Now that she is here, I will make it a point to talk to her about Mount Arreat.\n\nYou should do the same.",
  "67I never liked Nihlathak, but I never suspected that he'd betray us! I just can't understand how an Elder could do such a thing.",
  "140Your rescue of Anya was quite an accomplishment.",
  "80Thank you, hero, for rescuing me.\n\nTo show my personal gratitude, I give you this. I had it custom-made for you by Larzuk.",
  "43Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange for the demon's mercy, the misguided fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the Ancients, our most holy totem!\n\nDoing so will allow Baal to enter Mount Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I tried to stop Nihlathak, but he imprisoned me in that icy tomb.\n\nNihlathak must be stopped before he dooms the whole world. As much as I would love to strangle the life out of him, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.\n\nYou must go to his lair through this portal I've opened, kill him, and then bring back the Relic of the Ancients.\n\nStop Nihlathak from destroying what we have striven for eons to protect.",
  "90As noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, nothing can excuse his actions.",
  "50Regretfully, I know very little about this Relic. However, if what the others say is true, then Baal must not gain possession of it.\n\nStop Nihlathak... before all is lost.",
  "65My worst fear has come true. Nihlathak has gone mad.\n\nYou must stop him, before he gives the Relic to the Lord of Destruction!",
  "56Now, rescuing Anya -- that's good. Talking to me while Nihlathak hands over the Relic to Baal -- uh... that's bad!",
  "60I saw Nihlathak leave town just before you found Anya. He must be held accountable for his criminal deeds.\n\nFind him and bring him back, if you can. Likely, he won't come willingly, and you'll be forced to kill him.\n\nSo be it.",
  "55Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the Relic, he shall enter the mountain and wreak havoc there!\n\nI cannot believe that Nihlathak would give the Relic to Baal in any kind of trade. He's truly insane if he believes that he can deal with the Lord of Destruction.",
  "58Ohh... This is a truly horrible turn of events.\n\nI know it seems you have always been one step behind, my friend. But look at it this way... You have evil on the run.",
  "160...What's there to talk about?\n\nKill Nihlathak!",
  "63Nihlathak was never the kindest man. But for him to betray the whole world...\n\nAhh... Where shall his soul finally rest?",
  "65My advice is to go in quick and hit hard. Nihlathak can't be half as tough as the beasts you've faced out there.",
  "55You have stopped Nihlathak, but he didn't have the Relic! He must have already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will not be tested when he reaches Arreat's summit.\n\n...Damn Nihlathak!\n\nI do thank you for trying, though. Please, allow me to honor your courage by magically inscribing your name onto an item of your choosing. It's the least I can do.",
  "90Beware! Baal grows stronger with every passing moment.",
  "93Hmmm... What does Baal plan to do inside Mount Arreat?",
  "65So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on failures past. It is your future that matters more.",
  "57Nihlathak was a vile demon that shall find his home among the tortured minions of Hell!\n\nYou battled the Darkness without fear. I laud your skill and courage.",
  "37Every time I hear of you, warrior, your deeds become more legendary.\n\nBut take heed. You are approaching the very summit of Mount Arreat. I have never dared venture there. It is sacred -- our most holy place. The legends say it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who block the path of all who are unworthy.\n\nYour reputation here does not matter... It will be the Ancients who determine your worthiness.\n\nGood luck.",
  "63The Ancients are not our enemies. Remember that! They are our ancestors -- our gods.",
  "90A test of mettle is a fitting rite of passage for a Barbarian hero.",
  "72You wouldn't have to test yourself against the Ancients if it weren't for Nihlathak's treachery. He was a fool and deserves to suffer for eternity.",
  "75Every night, I've prayed to the Ancients to bring us peace... and now you must fight them.\n\nHuh... Who shall I pray to now, warrior?",
  "65By reaching the summit, you cease being just a simple warrior. When you come back, you will be far more.",
  "114I warned you!\n\nThe Ancients are not like the demons you're accustomed to fighting.",
  "52We have come too far to be defeated now, my friend. I have seen you complete many difficult quests. Though this may be your greatest trial, it is not beyond your reach.",
  "71Look. I must apologize.\n\nI feel responsible for your current struggle. If I had only stopped Nihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, you would not have to fight those ghosts.",
  "70You've walked on the burial grounds of our greatest ancestors. I'm not sure whether I should bow before you or revile you for committing sacrilege.\n\nTread lightly when you walk with gods.",
  "68Do not doubt yourself. I believe you are worthy to pass through the Ancients' gates, but you must believe, as well.",
  "75Besting the Ancients in battle is a mighty feat indeed. I hope this means you're ready to battle Baal.",
  "67You have proven yourself to these people. They look to you as their warrior, their champion.",
  "82You stand before me a worthy hero -- and on you rests the last hope of our people.\n\nBear it well, warrior.",
  "82The Ancients have honored you, and in turn, so do we. I have no remaining doubts about you, now.",
  "60I knew the Ancients would find you worthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, stop Baal before he destroys all that is sacred.",
  "31You are a worthy hero! We augment your skill and grant you entry to the interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies the Worldstone.\n\nBeware. You will not be alone. Baal the Lord of Destruction is already inside. \n\nThe Archangel Tyrael has always been our benefactor, but even he cannot help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's spiritual presence from entering the chamber of the Worldstone. Only you, mortal, have the power to defeat Baal now.\n\nBaal threatens the Worldstone -- and through it, the mortal realm, itself. You must stop him before he gains full control of the sacred stone. With it under his control, Baal could shatter the boundaries between this world and the Burning Hells, thus allowing the hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth into the mortal realm like an unstoppable tide!\n\nIf you are weak, the world as you know it could be lost forever. You must NOT fail!",
  "51Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful of the ancient Horadrim.\n\nYour battles with Mephisto and Diablo will pale in comparison to your battle with Baal.\n\nThe Lord of Destruction aided by Tal Rasha's knowledge... The mountain itself will tremble when you clash.",
  "59I may be just an armorer, but I know this... Baal plans to destroy the world with the secrets contained in that mountain. It doesn't take a genius to know he has to be stopped.",
  "70You knew it would eventually come down to this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!",
  "60Baal has blocked Tyrael from entering the Worldstone Chamber? This truly has become a battle against Hell.\n\nWhether or not it was the Heavens' decree, this is your fight now -- your destiny.",
  "63You have ventured to a place beyond legend. You rush to face an evil few can even imagine.\n\nBe careful, my friend, and may the Light watch over you.",
  "40I am impressed, mortal. You have overcome the greatest challenge this world has ever faced and defeated the last of the Prime Evils. However, we are too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's destructive touch has corrupted it completely.\n\nGiven enough time, the Worldstone's energies will drain away and the barriers between the worlds will shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood into this... Sanctuary... and eradicate your people and everything you've labored to build.\n\nTherefore, I must destroy the corrupted Worldstone before the powers of Hell take root. This act will change your world forever -- with consequences even I cannot foresee. However, it is the only way to ensure mankind's survival.\n\nGo now, mortal. I have opened a portal that will lead you to safety.\n\nMay the Eternal Light shine upon you and your descendants for what you've done this day. The continued survival of mankind is your legacy! Above all else, you have earned a rest from this endless battle.",
  "53You have done the impossible, hero. Your defeat of the last of the three Prime Evils is a great victory for the Light. \n\nStrange that you say that the Worldstone must be destroyed. The prophecies said nothing about that.\n\nPerhaps all we have fought for will be lost... or perhaps we'll never need fight again!",
  "40I knew in time you would defeat Baal. You have done everything you set out to do, my friend.\n\nEver since you rescued me from Tristram, I have believed in you. It has been a supreme honor to aid you along the way. \n\nSo... The Worldstone was corrupted by Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. Worry not. Through whatever lies ahead I have faith that the Light will guide us both.\n\nGo, now, back to the Worldstone chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael has opened for you.",
  "74The Ancients themselves will envy our songs about you.\n\nPlease, don't forget about us! Farewell, my friend.",
  "48If Tyrael says the Worldstone must be destroyed, then it must. We cannot let Baal's corruption prevail!\n\nThe world will change, true -- but who is to say it isn't for the better?",
  "60The destruction of the Worldstone does not bode well for our world. But I'll try not to worry...\n\nAfter all, we have warriors like you fighting for us and for the Light.\n\nFarewell!",
